This process involves much more than just technical knowledge, and this book provides you with all the information you'll need to understand the concepts behind designing and developing for the Web, as well as the best means to deliver professional, best-practice-based results. There is far more to building a successful website than knowing a little Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). The process starts long before any coding takes place, and this book introduces you to the agile development process, explaining why this method makes so much sense for web projects and how best to implement it. Planning is vital, so you'll also learn how to use techniques such as brainstorming, wireframes, mockups, and prototypes to get your project off to the best possible start and help ensure smooth progress as it develops. An understanding of correct, semantic markup is essential to any web professional, so this book explains how XHTML should be used to structure content so that the markup adheres to current web standards. You'll learn about the wide range of HTML elements available to you, and you'll learn how and when to use them through building example web pages. Without creative use of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), websites would all look largely the same. CSS gives you the ability to set your website apart from the rest while maintaining the integrity of your markup. You'll learn how CSS works and how to apply styles to your pages, enabling you to realize your design ideas in the browser. JavaScript can be used to make your website easier and more interesting to use. This book provides information on appropriate uses of this technology and introduces the concepts of programming using it. You'll also see how JavaScript works as part of the much-hyped technique Ajax and in turn where Ajax fits into the wider Web 2.0 picture. While a website is being built, it needs to be tested across multiple browsers and platforms to ensure that the site works for all users, regardless of ability or disability, and the book explains how best to do these tasks. Then, it discusses the process of launching and maintaining the site so that it will continue to work for all its users throughout its life-cycle. The book concludes by covering server-side technologies, acting as a guide to the different options available and explaining differences between available products. With insights from renowned experts such as Jason Fried of 37signals, Daniel Burka of Digg and Pownce, and Chris Messina of Citizen Agency, this book provides invaluable information applicable to every web project, regardless of size, scope, or budget.","language":"en","currency":"USD","id":"1430209925","title":"Foundation Website Creation with CSS, XHTML, and JavaScript","infoLink":"https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/books\/details?id=295iDEn7YCYC&source=gbs_api","authors":["Steve Smith","Jonathan Lane"]},{"pageCount":316,"thumbnail":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=ifhGYfylJngC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","price":16.54,"subtitle":null,"description":"Annotation Since its initial launch, Sencha Touch has quickly become the gold standard for developing rich mobile web applications with HTML5.

This process involves much more than just technical knowledge, and this book provides all the information you'll need to understand the concepts behind designing and developing for the Web, as well as the best means to deliver professional results based on best practices. Of course, there is far more to building a successful website than knowing a little Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). The process starts long before any coding takes place, and this book introduces you to the agile development process, explaining why this method makes so much sense for web projects and how best to implement it. We also make sure you're up to date by using the latest HTML5 features. Planning is vital, so you'll also learn to use techniques such as brainstorming, wireframes, mockups, and prototypes to get your project off to the best possible start and help ensure smooth progress as it develops. An understanding of correct, semantic markup is essential for any web professional; this book explains how HTML5 should be used to structure content so that the markup adheres to current web standards. You'll learn about the wide range of HTML5 elements available to you, and you'll learn how and when to use them through building example web pages. Without creative use of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), websites would all look largely the same. CSS enables you to set your website apart from the rest, while maintaining the integrity of your markup. We'll showcase the new features of CSS3 and how you can use them. You'll learn how CSS3 works and how to apply styles to your pages, allowing you to realize your design ideas in the browser. JavaScript can be used to make your website easier and more interesting to use. This book provides information on appropriate uses of this technology and introduces the concepts of JavaScript programming. You'll also see how JavaScript works as part of the much-hyped technique Ajax, and in turn, where Ajax fits into the wider Web 2.0 picture. While a website is being built, it needs to be tested across multiple browsers and platforms to ensure that the site works for all users, regardless of ability or disability, and this book explains how best to accomplish these tasks. Then, it discusses the process of launching and maintaining the site so that it will continue to work for all its users throughout its life cycle. Foundation Website Creation with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript concludes by covering server-side technologies, acting as a guide to the different options available. With insights from renowned experts such as Jason Fried of 37signals, Daniel Burka of Digg and Pownce, and Chris Messina of Citizen Agency, Foundation Website Creation with CSS, XHTML, and JavaScript provides invaluable information applicable to every web project\u2014regardless of size, scope, or budget.","language":"en","currency":"USD","id":"1430237902","title":"Foundation Website Creation with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript","infoLink":"https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/books\/details?id=-m08A3lsSUgC&source=gbs_api","authors":["Joe Lewis","Jonathan Lane","Meitar Moscovitz","Tom Barker"]},{"pageCount":120,"thumbnail":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=dAYvDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","price":14.99,"subtitle":null,"description":"If you've used a more traditional object-oriented language, such as C++ or Java, JavaScript probably doesn't seem object-oriented at all.

Palm and O'Reilly felt that it was important to have abook available to help developers get a basic understanding of the new Palmplatform at the time that the SDK was released; this timing played a majorrole in the content and structure of the book. Ideally this book would have been a complete reference of the new platformbut that wasn't possible since the content was written at the same time asthe software SDK was being developed by the Palm engineering team. The bookdoes provide a complete overview of Palm webOS, a thorough description ofthe application model and gives details on many key design concepts. Thereare descriptions and examples of UI widgets, services, storage,notifications, dashboards and background applications, serving as a greatintroduction but not as a definitive source. The book uses a simple News reader application to illustrate the technicaldescriptions but the examples are not intended to serve as a cookbooktutorial. Experienced developers should be able to use the examples to buildup a working application chapter by chapter but others may not find theloose descriptions adequate for recreating the application unaided. Overtime, these different needs will be filled by other books, but in themeantime we hope that this book will serve a valuable role introducingdevelopers to webOS and giving them a way of getting started with webOSapplication development.

Master existing JavaScript data structures such as array, set and map and learn how to implement new ones such as stacks, linked lists, trees and graphs. All concepts are explained in an easy way, followed by examples. Who This Book Is For If you are a student of Computer Science or are at the start of your technology career and want to explore JavaScript's optimum ability, this book is for you. You need a basic knowledge of JavaScript and programming logic to start having fun with algorithms. What You Will Learn Declare, initialize, add, and remove items from arrays, stacks, and queues Get the knack of using algorithms such as DFS (Depth-first Search) and BFS (Breadth-First Search) for the most complex data structures Harness the power of creating linked lists, doubly linked lists, and circular linked lists Store unique elements with hash tables, dictionaries, and sets Use binary trees and binary search trees Sort data structures using a range of algorithms such as bubble sort, insertion sort, and quick sort In Detail This book begins by covering basics of the JavaScript language and introducing ECMAScript 7, before gradually moving on to the current implementations of ECMAScript 6. You will gain an in-depth knowledge of how hash tables and set data structure functions, as well as how trees and hash maps can be used to search files in a HD or represent a database. This book is an accessible route deeper into JavaScript. Graphs being one of the most complex data structures you'll encounter, we'll also give you a better understanding of why and how graphs are largely used in GPS navigation systems in social networks. Toward the end of the book, you'll discover how all the theories presented by this book can be applied in real-world solutions while working on your own computer networks and Facebook searches. Style and approach This book gets straight to the point, providing you with examples of how a data structure or algorithm can be used and giving you real-world applications of the algorithm in JavaScript.

Ob Smartphone, DSL-Router oder auch beim Einkauf um die Ecke: Daten fallen überall in großer Menge an und werden gespeichert. Um diese großen Datenmengen effizient und nutzbringend einsetzen zu können, ist eine geeignete Darstellungsform notwendig. Mit D3.js steht eine JavaScript-Bibliothek bereit, um große Datenmengen in unterschiedlichsten Diagrammtypen darstellen zu können. Werden Sie damit Herr der Daten. Bevor Sie eigene Diagramme mit D3.js erstellen können, müssen Sie sich mit der entsprechenden Syntax auseinandersetzen. Gull erklärt Ihnen die wichtigsten Regeln im ersten Kapitel. Danach geht es direkt ans Eingemachte: Balkendiagramme, Kreisdiagramme und animierte Diagramme. Erleben Sie die großen Möglichkeiten von D3 anhand von eigenen Diagrammen. Nach einem theoretischen und praktischen Einstieg in den ersten beiden Kapiteln widmet sich das Kapitel 3 einer großen Anwendung, dem Métro Information Tracker. Hierbei nutzen Sie öffentlich zugängliche Daten (Open Data), um mit unterschiedlichen Diagrammen Informationen zur Métro in Paris darzustellen. Hierbei setzen Sie sich mit allen Themen auseinander, die die moderne Webentwicklung zu bieten hat: HTML, CSS, JSON und SVG. In einem Force-Directed-Graph stellen Sie die Daten dar und reichern diesen mit SVG-Grafiken an. Nachdem Sie dieses Projekt selbst umgesetzt haben, sind Sie gewappnet für eigene große D3-Anwendungen. Der Quellcode steht auch online zur Verfügung. So lernen Ihre Modelle das Laufen! Erfahren Sie, wie Sie eine Armatur - eine Art Skelett - für Ihre Charaktere erstellen und sie mit der 3-D-Grafik verknüpfen. Anschließend können Sie die Animationsphasen selbst erstellen und aufnehmen. Darüber hinaus sehen Sie, wie Sie Licht und Schatten für die Kameraaufnahme gekonnt einsetzen.

What You Will Learn Explore the usage of new syntaxes introduced by ES6 Use the new prototype-based features introduced by ES6 Execute ES6 in an old non-supported ES6 environment Write asynchronous code using promise to facilitate the writing of better asynchronous code that is easier to read and maintain Create and understand the usage of iterators, iterables, and generators Get to know object-oriented programming and create objects using classes Build proxies using the ES6 proxy API and understand its uses Create JavaScript libraries using ES6 modules In Detail ECMAScript 6 is the new edition to the ECMAScript language, whose specifications are inherited by JavaScript. ES6 gives a vast makeover to JavaScript by adding new syntaxes and APIs to write complex applications and libraries that are easier to debug and maintain. ES6 aims to keep JavaScript accessible for casual developers, even after adding so many new features. This book will provide step-by-step instructions on how to apply ES6 features instead of old JavaScript hacks and methods. The book will start by introducing all the built-in objects of ES6 and how to create ES6 custom Iterators. Next, it will teach you how to write asynchronous code in a synchronous style using ES6. Moving on, the book will teach how to use Reflect API to inspect and manipulate object properties. Next, it teaches how to create proxies, and use it to intercept and customize operations performed on objects. Finally, it explains old modular programming techniques such as IIFE, CommonJS, AMD, and UMD and also compares it with ES6 modules and how ES6 modules can increase the performance of websites when used. Style and approach This book is a pragmatic guide that takes you through the ES6 APIs and other features in a conversational and easy-to-follow style.

Christopher Van Wyk and Sedgewick have developed new C++ implementations that both express the methods in a concise and direct manner, and also provide programmers with the practical means to test them on real applications. Many new algorithms are presented, and the explanations of each algorithm are much more detailed than in previous editions. A new text design and detailed, innovative figures, with accompanying commentary, greatly enhance the presentation. The third edition retains the successful blend of theory and practice that has made Sedgewick's work an invaluable resource for more than 250,000 programmers! This particular book, Parts 1n4, represents the essential first half of Sedgewick's complete work. It provides extensive coverage of fundamental data structures and algorithms for sorting, searching, and related applications. Although the substance of the book applies to programming in any language, the implementations by Van Wyk and Sedgewick also exploit the natural match between C++ classes and ADT implementations. Highlights Expanded coverage of arrays, linked lists, strings, trees, and other basic data structures Greater emphasis on abstract data types (ADTs), modular programming, object-oriented programming, and C++ classes than in previous editions Over 100 algorithms for sorting, selection, priority queue ADT implementations, and symbol table ADT (searching) implementations New implementations of binomial queues, multiway radix sorting, randomized BSTs, splay trees, skip lists, multiway tries, B trees, extendible hashing, and much more Increased quantitative information about the algorithms, giving you a basis for comparing them Over 1000 new exercises to help you learn the properties of algorithms Whether you are learning the algorithms for the first time or wish to have up-to-date reference material that incorporates new programming styles with classic and new algorithms, you will find a wealth of useful information in this book.","language":"en","currency":"USD","id":"0768685036","title":"Algorithms in C++, Parts 1-4","infoLink":"https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/books\/details?id=ZCchAeprwvYC&source=gbs_api","authors":["Robert Sedgewick"]},{"pageCount":364,"thumbnail":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=cg9QDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","price":32.99,"subtitle":"Rapid, Confident, Maintainable Code","description":"Debunk the myth that JavaScript is not easily testable. Whether you use Node.js, Express, MongoDB, jQuery, AngularJS, or directly manipulate the DOM, you can test-drive JavaScript. Learn the craft of writing meaningful, deterministic automated tests with Karma, Mocha, and Chai. Test asynchronous JavaScript, decouple and properly mock out dependencies, measure code coverage, and create lightweight modular designs of both server-side and client-side code. Your investment in writing tests will pay high dividends as you create code that's predictable and cost-effective to change. Design and code JavaScript applications with automated tests. Writing meaningful tests is a skill that takes learning, some unlearning, and a lot of practice, and with this book, you'll hone that skill. Fire up the editor and get hands-on through practical exercises for effective automated testing and designing maintainable, modular code. Start by learning when and why to do manual testing vs. automated verification. Focus tests on the important things, like the pre-conditions, the invariants, complex logic, and gnarly edge cases. Then begin to design asynchronous functions using automated tests. Carefully decouple and mock out intricate dependencies such as the DOM, geolocation API, file and database access, and Ajax calls to remote servers. Step by step, test code that uses Node.js, Express, MongoDB, jQuery, and AngularJS. Know when and how to use tools such as Chai, Istanbul, Karma, Mocha, Protractor, and Sinon. Create tests with minimum effort and run them fast without having to spin up web servers or manually edit HTML pages to run in browsers. Then explore end-to-end testing to ensure all parts are wired and working well together. Don't just imagine creating testable code, write it. What You Need: A computer with a text editor and your favorite browser. The book provides instructions to install the necessary automated testing-related tools.","language":"en","currency":"USD","id":"1680504908","title":"Test-Driving JavaScript Applications","infoLink":"https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/books\/details?id=cg9QDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","authors":["Venkat Subramaniam"]},{"pageCount":816,"thumbnail":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=uT6eBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","price":31.19,"subtitle":"Solutions and Techniques in Ruby Programming","description":"For more than a decade, Ruby developers have turned to The Ruby Way for reliable \u201Chow-to\u201D guidance on effective Ruby programming.
