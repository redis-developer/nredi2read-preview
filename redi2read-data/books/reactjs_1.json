Learn how Reason differs from TypeScript and Flow, and how to use it to make refactoring less stressful. Book Description ReasonML, also known as Reason, is a new syntax and toolchain for OCaml that was created by Facebook and is meant to be approachable for web developers. Although OCaml has several resources, most of them are from the perspective of systems development. This book, alternatively, explores Reason from the perspective of web development. You'll learn how to use Reason to build safer, simpler React applications and why you would want to do so. Reason supports immutability by default, which works quite well in the context of React. In learning Reason, you will also learn about its ecosystem \u2013 BuckleScript, JavaScript interoperability, and various npm workflows. We learn by building a real-world app shell, including a client-side router with page transitions, that we can customize for any Reason project. You'll learn how to leverage OCaml's excellent type system to enforce guarantees about business logic, as well as preventing runtime type errors.You'll also see how the type system can help offload concerns that we once had to keep in our heads. We'll explore using CSS-in-Reason, how to use external JSON in Reason, and how to unit-test critical business logic.

What You Will Learn Get a clear overview of TDD in the context of JavaScript with a brief look at testing techniques, tools, and frameworks Get an overview of Karma and create test suites for an Angular application Install and configure Protractor for Angular and explore a few important Protractor APIs Understand automated testing and implement headless automated tests with Karma Implement testing techniques with mocks, broadcast events, and asynchronous behavior Integrate REST-based services and APIs into an application to extract data Automate Karma unit tests with Travis CI In Detail This is a complete guide that shows you testing techniques with Karma that will help you perform unit testing and end-to-end testing with Protractor. It will show you how to optimize your Angular development process using TDD techniques and ensure your final project is free of bugs. All examples in this book are based on Angular v2 and are compatible with Angular v4. We start by reviewing the TDD life cycle, TDD in the context of JavaScript, and various JavaScript test tools and frameworks. You will see how Karma and Protractor can make your life easier while running JavaScript unit tests. We will enable you to build a test suite for an Angular application and build a testable medium-to-large scale Angular application by handling REST API data. Building on the initial foundational aspects, we move on to testing for multiple classes, partial views, location references, CSS, and the HTML element. In addition, we will explore how to use a headless browser with Karma. We will also configure a Karma file to automate the testing and tackle elements of Angular (components, services, classes, and broadcasting) using TDD. Finally, you will find out how to pull data using an external API, set up and configure Protractor to use a standalone Selenium server, and set up Travis CI and Karma to test your application.

Rust is a language particularly well-suited for building microservices. It is a new system programming language that offers a practical and safe alternative to C. This book describes web development using the Rust programming language and will get you up and running with modern web frameworks and crates with examples of RESTful microservices creation. You will deep dive into Reactive programming, and asynchronous programming, and split your web application into a set of concurrent actors. The book provides several HTTP-handling examples with manageable memory allocations. You will walk through stateless high-performance microservices, which are ideally suitable for computation or caching tasks, and look at stateful microservices, which are filled with persistent data and database interactions. As we move along, you will learn how to use Rust macros to describe business or protocol entities of our application and compile them into native structs, which will be performed at full speed with the help of the server's CPU. Finally, you will be taken through examples of how to test and debug microservices and pack them into a tiny monolithic binary or put them into a container and deploy them to modern cloud platforms such as AWS. What you will learn Get acquainted with leveraging Rust web programming Get to grips with various Rust crates, such as hyper, Tokio, and Actix Explore RESTful microservices with Rust Understand how to pack Rust code to a container using Docker Familiarize yourself with Reactive microservices Deploy your microservices to modern cloud platforms such as AWS Who this book is for This book is for developers who have basic knowledge of RUST, and want to learn how to build, test, scale, and manage RUST microservices.
