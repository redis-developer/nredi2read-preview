Data has traditionally been stored in files or databases, and then analyzed by queries and applications. With stream computing, analysis is performed moment by moment as the data is in motion. In fact, the data might never be stored (perhaps only the analytic results). The ability to analyze data in motion is called real-time analytic processing (RTAP). IBM InfoSphere Streams takes a fundamentally different approach to Big Data analytics and differentiates itself with its distributed runtime platform, programming model, and tools for developing and debugging analytic applications that have a high volume and variety of data types. Using in-memory techniques and analyzing record by record enables high velocity. Volume, variety and velocity are the key attributes of Big Data. The data streams that are consumable by IBM InfoSphere Streams can originate from sensors, cameras, news feeds, stock tickers, and a variety of other sources, including traditional databases. It provides an execution platform and services for applications that ingest, filter, analyze, and correlate potentially massive volumes of continuous data streams. This book is intended for professionals that require an understanding of how to process high volumes of streaming data or need information about how to implement systems to satisfy those requirements.

Fachhochschule Frankfurt am Main, Sprache: Deutsch, Abstract: Für viele Unternehmen sind sie elementar wichtig, für Benutzer von Smartphones, Social Media-Anwendungen, Online-Shops sowie diverser Plattformen sind sie dagegen nicht von großer Bedeutung. Die Rede ist von \"Daten\". Da Daten aus Unternehmenssicht wichtige Informationen, wie zum Beispiel das Kaufverhalten eines Kunden reflektieren, spielen sie heutzutage eine wichtige Rolle bei der Gewinngenerierung. Beispielsweise versuchen Unternehmen anhand von verschiedenen BI-Lösungen, diese gespeicherten Daten auszuwerten, um eine Gewinnmaximierung zu erzielen. Laut der Digital-Universe-Studie von IDC verdoppelt sich der komplette Datenbestand alle zweieinhalb Jahre und soll im Jahre 2020 in Westeuropa auf fünf Zetabyte anwachsen. Die Studie besagt zudem, dass das Datenvolumen 2020 auf dem gesamten Globus 44 Zetabyte betragen wird. An einigen Beispielen lässt sich der explosiv wachsende Datenbestand aufzeigen: (1) Derzeit wären acht Jahre nötig, um alle Videos in YouTube, die täglich hochgeladen werden, anzuschauen. (2) Es werden in Facebook pro Minute 2,46 Millionen Inhalte geteilt. (3) Die Summe der Datensätze ist aktuell größer als die Zahl aller Sterne im Universum. Solch große Datenansammlungen, die aufgrund des Web 2.0 entstanden sind, brachten vor einigen Jahren das Trendwort \"BIG DATA\" hervor. Die Entwicklung von Big Data brachte vielen Unternehmen nicht nur profitable Informationen, sondern ließ auch deren Datenbanken und Datenbank-Management-Systeme an ihre Grenzen stoßen. Herausforderungen, wie z. B. die schnelle Verarbeitung vieler Datensätze, sind aufgrund der Komplexität und der Datenstruktur von relationalen Datenbank-Management-Systemen nicht mehr leicht zu bewältigen. Diese Herausforderungen stießen den Durchbruch der NoSQL-Datenbanken an.
