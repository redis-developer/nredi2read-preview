More importantly, you will be challenged to reassess your professional values and your commitment to your craft. Clean Code is divided into three parts. The first describes the principles, patterns, and practices of writing clean code. The second part consists of several case studies of increasing complexity. Each case study is an exercise in cleaning up code\u2013of transforming a code base that has some problems into one that is sound and efficient. The third part is the payoff: a single chapter containing a list of heuristics and \u201Csmells\u201D gathered while creating the case studies.

Previously undocumented, these 23 patterns allow designers to create more flexible, elegant, and ultimately reusable designs without having to rediscover the design solutions themselves. The authors begin by describing what patterns are and how they can help you design object-oriented software. They then go on to systematically name, explain, evaluate, and catalog recurring designs in object-oriented systems. With Design Patterns as your guide, you will learn how these important patterns fit into the software development process, and how you can leverage them to solve your own design problems most efficiently. Each pattern describes the circumstances in which it is applicable, when it can be applied in view of other design constraints, and the consequences and trade-offs of using the pattern within a larger design. All patterns are compiled from real systems and are based on real-world examples. Each pattern also includes code that demonstrates how it may be implemented in object-oriented programming languages like C++ or Smalltalk.","language":"en","currency":"USD","id":"9780321700698","title":"Design Patterns","infoLink":"https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/books\/details?id=6oHuKQe3TjQC&source=gbs_api","authors":["Erich Gamma","Richard Helm","Ralph Johnson","John Vlissides"]},{"pageCount":240,"thumbnail":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=d2CMAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","price":17.27,"subtitle":"A Short Course on the Basics","description":"Eagerly anticipated by millions of programmers, Java SE 8 is the most important Java update in many years.

Martin (a.k.a. Uncle Bob) This isn\u2019t the first book on Java application architecture. No doubt it won\u2019t be the last. But rest assured, this title is different. The way we develop Java applications is about to change, and this title explores the new way of Java application architecture. Over the past several years, module frameworks have been gaining traction on the Java platform, and upcoming versions of Java will include a module system that allows you to leverage the power of modularity to build more resilient and flexible software systems. Modularity isn\u2019t a new concept. But modularity will change the way we develop Java applications, and you\u2019ll only be able to realize the benefits if you understand how to design more modular software systems. Java Application Architecture will help you Design modular software that is extensible, reusable, maintainable, and adaptable Design modular software today, in anticipation of future platform support for modularity Break large software systems into a flexible composite of collaborating modules Understand where to place your architectural focus Migrate large-scale monolithic applications to applications with a modular architecture Articulate the advantages of modular software to your team Java Application Architecture lays the foundation you\u2019ll need to incorporate modular design thinking into your development initiatives. Before it walks you through eighteen patterns that will help you architect modular software, it lays a solid foundation that shows you why modularity is a critical weapon in your arsenal of design tools. Throughout, you\u2019ll find examples that illustrate the concepts. By designing modular applications today, you are positioning yourself for the platform and architecture of tomorrow.

Many Enterprise Java developers, accustomed to dealing with Java's spiraling complexity, have fallen into the habit of choosing overly complicated solutions to problems when simpler options are available. Building server applications with \"heavyweight\" Java-based architectures, such as WebLogic, JBoss, and WebSphere, can be costly and cumbersome. When you've reached the point where you spend more time writing code to support your chosen framework than to solve your actual problems, it's time to think in terms of simplicity.In Better, Faster, Lighter Java, authors Bruce Tate and Justin Gehtland argue that the old heavyweight architectures are unwieldy, complicated, and contribute to slow and buggy application code. As an alternative means for building better applications, the authors present two \"lightweight\" open source architectures: Hibernate--a persistence framework that does its job with a minimal API and gets out of the way, and Spring--a container that's not invasive, heavy or complicated.Hibernate and Spring are designed to be fairly simple to learn and use, and place reasonable demands on system resources. Better, Faster, Lighter Java shows you how they can help you create enterprise applications that are easier to maintain, write, and debug, and are ultimately much faster.Written for intermediate to advanced Java developers, Better, Faster, Lighter Java, offers fresh ideas--often unorthodox--to help you rethink the way you work, and techniques and principles you'll use to build simpler applications.

This new edition of the best-selling industry standard shows you how to create systems that run longer, with fewer failures, and recover better when bad things happen. New coverage includes DevOps, microservices, and cloud-native architecture. Stability antipatterns have grown to include systemic problems in large-scale systems. This is a must-have pragmatic guide to engineering for production systems. If you're a software developer, and you don't want to get alerts every night for the rest of your life, help is here. With a combination of case studies about huge losses - lost revenue, lost reputation, lost time, lost opportunity - and practical, down-to-earth advice that was all gained through painful experience, this book helps you avoid the pitfalls that cost companies millions of dollars in downtime and reputation. Eighty percent of project life-cycle cost is in production, yet few books address this topic. This updated edition deals with the production of today's systems - larger, more complex, and heavily virtualized - and includes information on chaos engineering, the discipline of applying randomness and deliberate stress to reveal systematic problems. Build systems that survive the real world, avoid downtime, implement zero-downtime upgrades and continuous delivery, and make cloud-native applications resilient. Examine ways to architect, design, and build software - particularly distributed systems - that stands up to the typhoon winds of a flash mob, a Slashdotting, or a link on Reddit.

It has always been about choice. Java EE focused on a few technologies, largely to the detriment of alternative, better solutions. When the Spring framework debuted, few would have agreed that Java EE represented the best-in-breed architectures of the day. Spring debuted to great fanfare, because it sought to simplify Java EE. Each release since marks the introduction of new features designed to both simplify and enable solutions. With version 2.0 and later, the Spring framework started targeting multiple platforms. The framework provided services on top of existing platforms, as always, but was decoupled from the underlying platform wherever possible. Java EE is a still a major reference point, but it\u2019s not the only target. OSGi (a promising technology for modular architectures) has been a big part of the SpringSource strategy here. Additionally, the Spring framework runs on Google App Engine. With the introduction of annotation-centric frameworks and XML schemas, SpringSource has built frameworks that effectively model the domain of a specific problem, in effect creating domain-specific languages (DSLs). Frameworks built on top of the Spring framework have emerged supporting application integration, batch processing, Flex and Flash integration, GWT, OSGi, and much more.","language":"en","currency":"USD","id":"1430225009","title":"Spring Recipes","infoLink":"https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/books\/details?id=hNiDt7On8HwC&source=gbs_api","authors":["Gary Mak","Daniel Rubio","Josh Long"]},{"pageCount":312,"thumbnail":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=nLgrDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","price":17.99,"subtitle":"A Hands-On Introduction to Programming","description":"Java is the world\u2019s most popular programming language, but it\u2019s known for having a steep learning curve.

The book is structured around practical recipes, where each recipe discusses a performance case or performance-related case, and almost every recipe has one or more applications. Mainly, when we try to accomplish something (e.g., read some data from the database), there are several approaches to do it, and, in order to choose the best way, you have to know the implied trades-off from a performance perspective. You\u2019ll see that in the end, all these penalties slow down the application. Besides presenting the arguments that favor a certain choice, the application is written in Spring Boot style which is quite different than plain Hibernate. Persistence is an important set of techniques and technologies for accessing and using data, and this book demonstrates that data is mobile regardless of specific applications and contexts. In Java development, persistence is a key factor in enterprise, ecommerce, cloud and other transaction-oriented applications.
