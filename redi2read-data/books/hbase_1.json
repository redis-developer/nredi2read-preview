Acclaimed technologist and inventor Amir Husain explains how we can live amidst the coming age of sentient machines and artificial intelligence\u2014and not only survive, but thrive. Artificial \u201Cmachine\u201D intelligence is playing an ever-greater role in our society. We are already using cruise control in our cars, automatic checkout at the drugstore, and are unable to live without our smartphones. The discussion around AI is polarized; people think either machines will solve all problems for everyone, or they will lead us down a dark, dystopian path into total human irrelevance. Regardless of what you believe, the idea that we might bring forth intelligent creation can be intrinsically frightening. But what if our greatest role as humans so far is that of creators? Amir Husain, a brilliant inventor and computer scientist, argues that we are on the cusp of writing our next, and greatest, creation myth. It is the dawn of a new form of intellectual diversity, one that we need to embrace in order to advance the state of the art in many critical fields, including security, resource management, finance, and energy. \u201CIn The Sentient Machine, Husain prepares us for a brighter future; not with hyperbole about right and wrong, but with serious arguments about risk and potential\u201D (Dr. Greg Hyslop, Chief Technology Officer, The Boeing Company). He addresses broad existential questions surrounding the coming of AI: Why are we valuable? What can we create in this world? How are we intelligent? What constitutes progress for us? And how might we fail to progress? Husain boils down complex computer science and AI concepts into clear, plainspoken language and draws from a wide variety of cultural and historical references to illustrate his points. Ultimately, Husain challenges many of our societal norms and upends assumptions we hold about \u201Cthe good life.\u201D","language":"en","currency":"USD","id":"1501144693","title":"The Sentient Machine","infoLink":"https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/books\/details?id=7rOuDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","authors":["Amir Husain"]},{"pageCount":316,"thumbnail":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=ZhqoKt3BF8sC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","price":18.49,"subtitle":null,"description":"Realistic, simple code examples to solve problems at scale with Hadoop and related technologies.","language":"en","currency":"USD","id":"1849519137","title":"Hadoop Real-World Solutions Cookbook","infoLink":"https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/books\/details?id=ZhqoKt3BF8sC&source=gbs_api","authors":["Jonathan R.

Fortunately, this book is the one.\" Feng Yu. Computing Reviews. June 28, 2016. This is a book for enterprise architects, database administrators, and developers who need to understand the latest developments in database technologies. It is the book to help you choose the correct database technology at a time when concepts such as Big Data, NoSQL and NewSQL are making what used to be an easy choice into a complex decision with significant implications. The relational database (RDBMS) model completely dominated database technology for over 20 years. Today this \"one size fits all\" stability has been disrupted by a relatively recent explosion of new database technologies. These paradigm-busting technologies are powering the \"Big Data\" and \"NoSQL\" revolutions, as well as forcing fundamental changes in databases across the board. Deciding to use a relational database was once truly a no-brainer, and the various commercial relational databases competed on price, performance, reliability, and ease of use rather than on fundamental architectures. Today we are faced with choices between radically different database technologies. Choosing the right database today is a complex undertaking, with serious economic and technological consequences. Next Generation Databases demystifies today\u2019s new database technologies. The book describes what each technology was designed to solve. It shows how each technology can be used to solve real word application and business problems. Most importantly, this book highlights the architectural differences between technologies that are the critical factors to consider when choosing a database platform for new and upcoming projects.

Today, a myriad data sources, from the Internet to business operations to scientific instruments, produce large and valuable data streams. However, the processing capabilities of single machines have not kept up with the size of data. As a result, organizations increasingly need to scale out their computations over clusters. At the same time, the speed and sophistication required of data processing have grown. In addition to simple queries, complex algorithms like machine learning and graph analysis are becoming common. And in addition to batch processing, streaming analysis of real-time data is required to let organizations take timely action. Future computing platforms will need to not only scale out traditional workloads, but support these new applications too. This book, a revised version of the 2014 ACM Dissertation Award winning dissertation, proposes an architecture for cluster computing systems that can tackle emerging data processing workloads at scale. Whereas early cluster computing systems, like MapReduce, handled batch processing, our architecture also enables streaming and interactive queries, while keeping MapReduce's scalability and fault tolerance. And whereas most deployed systems only support simple one-pass computations (e.g., SQL queries), ours also extends to the multi-pass algorithms required for complex analytics like machine learning. Finally, unlike the specialized systems proposed for some of these workloads, our architecture allows these computations to be combined, enabling rich new applications that intermix, for example, streaming and batch processing. We achieve these results through a simple extension to MapReduce that adds primitives for data sharing, called Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs). We show that this is enough to capture a wide range of workloads. We implement RDDs in the open source Spark system, which we evaluate using synthetic and real workloads. Spark matches or exceeds the performance of specialized systems in many domains, while offering stronger fault tolerance properties and allowing these workloads to be combined. Finally, we examine the generality of RDDs from both a theoretical modeling perspective and a systems perspective. This version of the dissertation makes corrections throughout the text and adds a new section on the evolution of Apache Spark in industry since 2014. In addition, editing, formatting, and links for the references have been added.","language":"en","currency":"USD","id":"1970001577","title":"An Architecture for Fast and General Data Processing on Large Clusters","infoLink":"https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/books\/details?id=TNUlDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","authors":["Matei Zaharia"]},{"pageCount":106,"thumbnail":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=w8bjqM4LUJkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","price":9.99,"subtitle":"Tools for Data Analysts","description":"If you want to use CouchDB to support real-world applications, you'll need to create MapReduce views that let you query this document-oriented database for meaningful data.
