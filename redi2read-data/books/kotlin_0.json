Although our primary focus is on JVM and Android, the knowledge we\u2019re sharing here, to various extents, applies to other Kotlin-supported platforms such as JavaScript, native and even multi-platform applications. The book starts with an introduction to the language and its ecosystem, which will give you an understanding of the key ideas behind the Kotlin design, introduce you to the Kotlin tooling and present you the basic language syntax and constructs. In the next chapters, we get to know the multi-paradigm nature of Kotlin which allows us to create powerful abstractions by combining various aspects of functional and object-oriented programming. We\u2019ll talk about using common Kotlin APIs, such as the standard library, reflection, and coroutine-based concurrency as well as the means for creating your own flexible APIs based on domain-specific languages. In the concluding chapters, we give examples of using Kotlin for more specialized tasks, such as testing, building Android applications, Web development and creating microservices. KEY FEATURES ● Language fundamentals ● Object-oriented and functional programming with Kotlin ● Kotlin standard library ● Building domain-specific languages ● Using Kotlin for Web development ● Kotlin for Android platform ● Coroutine-based concurrency WHAT WILL YOU LEARN By the end of the book you\u2019ll obtain a thorough knowledge of all the basic aspects of Kotlin programming. You\u2019ll be able to create a flexible and reusable code by taking advantage of object-oriented and functional features, use Kotlin standard library, compose your own domain-specific languages, write asynchronous code using Kotlin coroutines library as well. You\u2019ll also have a basic understanding of using Kotlin for writing test code, web applications and Android development. This knowledge will also give you a solid foundation for deeper learning of related development platforms, tools, and frameworks. WHO IS THIS BOOK FOR The book is primarily aimed at developers who are familiar with Java and JVM and are willing to get a firm understanding of Kotlin while having little to no experience in that language. Discussion of various language features will be accompanied, if deemed necessary, by comparisons with their Java\u2019s analogs, which should simplify the Java-to-Kotlin transition. Most of the material, however, is rather Java-agnostic and should be beneficial even without prior knowledge of Java. In general, experience in object-oriented or functional paradigm is a plus, but not required. Table of Contents 1. Kotlin: Powerful and Pragmatic 2. Language Fundamentals 3. Defining Functions 4.

For example, the application is using Architecture components, including ViewModel, LiveData, NavigationComponent, and also it uses Flow, which is a hot topic in Kotlin. While we learn this concept, along with that, we also develop a sample application where we can apply our learning and, in the end, have some tangible and measurable output. Readers with little previous knowledge of Android application development can easily follow this book. Most of the chapters are code-heavy and focuses on practical usage of Kotlin\u2019s features. Each chapter has code on the GitHub. You can check out this code and try it out. Or you can develop in parallel and cherry-pick things from the sample code base as and when you need it. Few chapters also follow the quiz at the end, and you can self assess yourself by going through that quiz. In total there are ten chapters. KEY FEATURES The book has theories explained elaborately along with Kotlin code and corresponding output to support the theoretical explanations. The Kotlin codes are provided with step-by-step comments to explain each instruction of the code. The book is quite well balanced with programs and illustrative real-case problems. The book is not just explaining theoretical concepts of the language. Still, it explains how the full-fledged application can be developed using some latest tools and technologies and create an excellent Android application using Kotlin. Few of the chapter offers the quiz at the end of it. And you can revise the concepts quickly. A rich sample application is created to demonstrate Kotlin\u2019s capability in various parts of the application. Quite the latest concepts are discussed in depth. For example, Flow, NavigationComponent, Coroutine, ViewModel, and LiveData. WHAT WILL YOU LEARN Know the basics and many advanced concepts of Android. Able to code in Kotlin for your Android application. You will know how architecture components can be used in Android application with Kotlin.

Previously undocumented, these 23 patterns allow designers to create more flexible, elegant, and ultimately reusable designs without having to rediscover the design solutions themselves. The authors begin by describing what patterns are and how they can help you design object-oriented software. They then go on to systematically name, explain, evaluate, and catalog recurring designs in object-oriented systems. With Design Patterns as your guide, you will learn how these important patterns fit into the software development process, and how you can leverage them to solve your own design problems most efficiently. Each pattern describes the circumstances in which it is applicable, when it can be applied in view of other design constraints, and the consequences and trade-offs of using the pattern within a larger design. All patterns are compiled from real systems and are based on real-world examples. Each pattern also includes code that demonstrates how it may be implemented in object-oriented programming languages like C++ or Smalltalk.","language":"en","currency":"USD","id":"9780321700698","title":"Design Patterns","infoLink":"https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/books\/details?id=6oHuKQe3TjQC&source=gbs_api","authors":["Erich Gamma","Richard Helm","Ralph Johnson","John Vlissides"]},{"pageCount":424,"thumbnail":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=8GGNDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","price":18.12,"subtitle":null,"description":"【本書の内容】 Kotlinは、Javaとの相互運用を可能にし、Android OSでGoogleがフルサポートする静的型プログラミング言語です。 この言語は、Javaだけでは十全ではない(Javaだけでは実装に手間がかかりすぎる)、軽量かつ豊かな表現形式や、他言語ではすでに実装されている最新の機能を盛り込んでいます。 本書はこの新しい開発言語・Kotlinを使った正しく、効果的な開発方法と、この言語がもっている主要な概念と基礎的なAPIを丹念に説明します。とくにJetBrainsのIntelliJ IDE開発環境についても紹介しています。 経験豊富なAndroid開発者でも、はじめてプログラミング言語を学ぶ新人開発者でも、Kotlinの最初の原則から高度な使い方まで導いてくれることでしょう。 【本書のポイント】 ・Kotlinはもちろん、開発環境のインストールから詳解 ・サンプルソースコードの変更点がひと目で分かる ・PCだけではなく、Androidアプリまで網羅 【読者が得られること】 ・Kotlinによるアプリケーション開発 ・IntelliJを使った開発方法 ・Javaとの相互運用方法 【対象読者】 ・プログラミング初学者 ・Androidアプリ開発者 ・JavaからKotlinに乗り換えたい開発者 \u203B本電子書籍は同名出版物を底本として作成しました。記載内容は印刷出版当時のものです。 \u203B印刷出版再現のため電子書籍としては不要な情報を含んでいる場合があります。 \u203B印刷出版とは異なる表記・表現の場合があります。予めご了承ください。 \u203Bプレビューにてお手持ちの電子端末での表示状態をご確認の上、商品をお買い求めください。 (翔泳社)","language":"ja","currency":"USD","id":"4798160733","title":"Kotlinプログラミング","infoLink":"https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/books\/details?id=8GGNDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","authors":["Josh Skeen","David Greenhalgh"]},{"pageCount":322,"thumbnail":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=g5AwDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","price":31.81,"subtitle":"Simple Solutions to Difficult Problems in Java 8 and 9","description":"The introduction of functional programming concepts in Java SE 8 was a drastic change for this venerable object-oriented language.

In the best tradition of Lisp, Clojure gets out of your way so you can focus on expressing simple solutions to hard problems. Clojure cuts through complexity by providing a set of composable tools--immutable data, functions, macros, and the interactive REPL. Written by members of the Clojure core team, this book is the essential, definitive guide to Clojure. This new edition includes information on all the newest features of Clojure, such as transducers and specs. Clojure joins the flexibility and agility of Lisp with the reach, stability, and performance of Java. Combine Clojure's tools for maximum effectiveness as you work with immutable data, functional programming, and safe concurrency to write programs that solve real-world problems. Start by reading and understanding Clojure syntax and see how Clojure is evaluated. From there, find out about the sequence abstraction, which combines immutable collections with functional programming to create truly reusable data transformation code. Clojure is a functional language; learn how to write programs in a functional style, and when and how to use recursion to your advantage. Discover Clojure's unique approach to state and identity, techniques for polymorphism and open systems using multimethods and protocols, and how to leverage Clojure's metaprogramming capabilities via macros. Finally, put all the pieces together in a real program. New to this edition is coverage of Clojure's spec library, one of the most interesting new features of Clojure for describing both data and functions.

But if code isn\u2019t clean, it can bring a development organization to its knees. Every year, countless hours and significant resources are lost because of poorly written code. But it doesn\u2019t have to be that way. Noted software expert Robert C. Martin presents a revolutionary paradigm with Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship . Martin has teamed up with his colleagues from Object Mentor to distill their best agile practice of cleaning code \u201Con the fly\u201D into a book that will instill within you the values of a software craftsman and make you a better programmer\u2013but only if you work at it.

More importantly, you will be challenged to reassess your professional values and your commitment to your craft. Clean Code is divided into three parts. The first describes the principles, patterns, and practices of writing clean code. The second part consists of several case studies of increasing complexity. Each case study is an exercise in cleaning up code\u2013of transforming a code base that has some problems into one that is sound and efficient. The third part is the payoff: a single chapter containing a list of heuristics and \u201Csmells\u201D gathered while creating the case studies. The result is a knowledge base that describes the way we think when we write, read, and clean code. Readers will come away from this book understanding How to tell the difference between good and bad code How to write good code and how to transform bad code into good code How to create good names, good functions, good objects, and good classes How to format code for maximum readability How to implement complete error handling without obscuring code logic How to unit test and practice test-driven development This book is a must for any developer, software engineer, project manager, team lead, or systems analyst with an interest in producing better code.","language":"en","currency":"USD","id":"0136083250","title":"Clean Code","infoLink":"https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/books\/details?id=_i6bDeoCQzsC&source=gbs_api","authors":["Robert C.

They aren't conscious of all the choices they make, like how they format their source, the names they use for variables, or the kinds of loops they use. They're focused entirely on problems they're solving, solutions they're creating, and algorithms they're implementing. So they write code in the way that seems natural, that happens intuitively, and that feels good. But if you're serious about your profession, intuition isn't enough. Perl Best Practices author Damian Conway explains that rules, conventions, standards, and practices not only help programmers communicate and coordinate with one another, they also provide a reliable framework for thinking about problems, and a common language for expressing solutions. This is especially critical in Perl, because the language is designed to offer many ways to accomplish the same task, and consequently it supports many incompatible dialects. With a good dose of Aussie humor, Dr. Conway (familiar to many in the Perl community) offers 256 guidelines on the art of coding to help you write better Perl code--in fact, the best Perl code you possibly can. The guidelines cover code layout, naming conventions, choice of data and control structures, program decomposition, interface design and implementation, modularity, object orientation, error handling, testing, and debugging. They're designed to work together to produce code that is clear, robust, efficient, maintainable, and concise, but Dr. Conway doesn't pretend that this is the one true universal and unequivocal set of best practices. Instead, Perl Best Practices offers coherent and widely applicable suggestions based on real-world experience of how code is actually written, rather than on someone's ivory-tower theories on howsoftware ought to be created. Most of all, Perl Best Practices offers guidelines that actually work, and that many developers around the world are already using. Much like Perl itself, these guidelines are about helping you to get your job done, without getting in the way. Praise for Perl Best Practices from Perl community members: \"As a manager of a large Perl project, I'd ensure that every member of my team has a copy of Perl Best Practices on their desk, and use it as the basis for an in-house style guide.\"-- Randal Schwartz \"There are no more excuses for writing bad Perl programs. All levels of Perl programmer will be more productive after reading this book.\"-- Peter Scott \"Perl Best Practices will be the next big important book in the evolution of Perl. The ideas and practices Damian lays down will help bring Perl out from under the embarrassing heading of \"scripting languages\". Many of us have known Perl is a real programming language, worthy of all the tasks normally delegated to Java and C++. With Perl Best Practices, Damian shows specifically how and why, so everyone else can see, too.\"-- Andy Lester \"Damian's done what many thought impossible: show how to build large, maintainable Perl applications, while still letting Perl be the powerful, expressive language that programmers have loved for years.\"-- Bill Odom \"Finally, a means to bring lasting order to the process and product of real Perl development teams.\"-- Andrew Sundstrom \"Perl Best Practices provides a valuable education in how to write robust, maintainable Perl, and is a definitive citation source when coaching other programmers.\"-- Bennett Todd\"I've been teaching Perl for years, and find the same question keeps being asked: Where can I find a reference for writing reusable, maintainable Perl code? Finally I have a decent answer.\"-- Paul Fenwick\"At last a well researched, well thought-out, comprehensive guide to Perl style. Instead of each of us developing our own, we can learn good practices from one of Perl's most prolific and experienced authors.

Even if you don't intend to follow all of the practices, thinking through your style will improve it.\"-- Steven Lembark\"The Perl community's best author is back with another outstanding book.

You might think the problem is your brain. It seems to have a mind of its own, a mind that doesn't always want to take in the dry, technical stuff you're forced to study. The fact is your brain craves novelty. It's constantly searching, scanning, waiting for something unusual to happen. After all, that's the way it was built to help you stay alive. It takes all the routine, ordinary, dull stuff and filters it to the background so it won't interfere with your brain's real work--recording things that matter. How does your brain know what matters? It's like the creators of the Head First approach say, suppose you're out for a hike and a tiger jumps in front of you, what happens in your brain? Neurons fire. Emotions crank up. Chemicals surge. That's how your brain knows. And that's how your brain will learn Java. Head First Java combines puzzles, strong visuals, mysteries, and soul-searching interviews with famous Java objects to engage you in many different ways. It's fast, it's fun, and it's effective. And, despite its playful appearance, Head First Java is serious stuff: a complete introduction to object-oriented programming and Java. You'll learn everything from the fundamentals to advanced topics, including threads, network sockets, and distributed programming with RMI. And the new. second edition focuses on Java 5.0, the latest version of the Java language and development platform. Because Java 5.0 is a major update to the platform, with deep, code-level changes, even more careful study and implementation is required. So learning the Head First way is more important than ever. If you've read a Head First book, you know what to expect--a visually rich format designed for the way your brain works. If you haven't, you're in for a treat. You'll see why people say it's unlike any other Java book you've ever read. By exploiting how your brain works, Head First Java compresses the time it takes to learn and retain--complex information. Its unique approach not only shows you what you need to know about Java syntax, it teaches you to think like a Java programmer. If you want to be bored, buy some other book.

The recipes inside range from how to perform simple tasks, like importing external data, to ways of handling issues that are more complicated, like set algebra. Authors Ales Spetic and Jonathan Gennick, two authorities with extensive database and SQL programming experience, include a discussion with each recipe to explain the logic and concepts underlying the solution.SQL (Structured Query Language) is the closest thing to a standard query language that currently exists, and Transact-SQL -- a full-featured programming language that dramatically extends the power of SQL -- is the procedural language of choice for both Microsoft SQL Server and Sybase SQL Server systems. The Transact-SQL Cookbook is designed so you can use the recipes directly, as a source of ideas, or as a way to learn a little more about SQL and what you can do with it. Topics covered include: Audit logging. In addition to recipes for implementing an audit log, this chapter also includes recipes for: improving performance where large log tables are involved; supporting multiple-languages; and simulating server push. Hierarchies. Recipes show you how to manipulate hierarchical data using Transact-SQL. Importing data. This chapter introduces concepts like normalization and recipes useful for working with imported data tables. Sets. Recipes demonstrate different operations, such as how to find common elements, summarize the data in a set, and find the element in a set that represents an extreme. Statistics. This chapter?s recipes show you how to effectively use SQL for common statistical operations from means and standard deviations to weighted moving averages. Temporal data. Recipes demonstrate how to construct queries against time-based data. Data Structures. This chapter shows how to manipulate data structures like stacks, queues, matrices, and arrays.
