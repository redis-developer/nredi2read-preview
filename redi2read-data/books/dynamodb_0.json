This is the book your Systems Integrator and your Application Software vendor don\u2019t want you to read. Enterprise IT (Information Technology) is a $3.8 trillion per year industry worldwide. Most of it is waste. We've grown used to projects costing tens of millions or even billions of dollars, and routinely running over budget and schedule many times over. These overages in both time and money are almost all wasted resources. However, the waste is hard to see, after being so marbled through all the products, processes, and guiding principles. That is what this book is about. We must see, understand, and agree about the problem before we can take coordinated action to address it. The trajectory of this book is as follows: In Chapter 1, we explore how bad the current state is. The three industries that address software waste are discussed, including the legacy software industry, neo-legacy software industry, and legacy modernization industry. Examples of application waste are illustrated from both public and private sectors. In Chapter 2, we explore the economics of the software industry. Although the economic tradeoffs are changing at the speed of Moore\u2019s Law, our approaches are not keeping pace. Learn how information systems really behave in terms of actual application development. In Chapter 3 we use \u201Croot cause analysis\u201D to reveal the real contributors to this situation, which are dependency, redundancy, complexity, and application centricity. Chapter 4 recounts the many failed attempts we\u2019ve made in the past to deal with information system complexity, including relational databases, ERP systems, enterprise data modeling, service oriented architectures, and APIs, Agile, data warehouse and business intelligence, outsourcing and offshoring, cloud, Software as a Service (SaaS), data lakes, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. Chapter 5 dismantles seven fallacies that contribute to our remaining stuck. For example, the first fallacy is \u201CWe need detailed requirements or we won\u2019t get what we want.\u201D The quagmire is not affecting all sectors of the economy equally. Chapter 6 looks at how this is playing out in the government and private sectors, large and small companies, and various parts of the IT industry itself.

This book is for you! Building APIs that consumers love should certainly be the goal of any API initiative. However, it is easier said than done. It requires getting the architecture for your APIs right. This book equips you with both foundations and best practices for API architecture. This book is for you if you want to understand the big picture of API design and development, you want to define an API architecture, establish a platform for APIs or simply want to build APIs your consumers love. This book is NOT for you, if you are looking for a step-by step guide for building APIs, focusing on every detail of the correct application of REST principles. In this case I recommend the book \"API Design\" of the API-University Series. What is API architecture? Architecture spans the bigger picture of APIs and can be seen from several perspectives: API architecture may refer to the architecture of the complete solution consisting not only of the API itself, but also of an API client such as a mobile app and several other components. API solution architecture explains the components and their relations within the software solution. API architecture may refer to the technical architecture of the API platform. When building, running and exposing not only one, but several APIs, it becomes clear that certain building blocks of the API, runtime functionality and management functionality for the API need to be used over and over again. An API platform provides an infrastructure for developing, running and managing APIs. API architecture may refer to the architecture of the API portfolio. The API portfolio contains all APIs of the enterprise and needs to be managed like a product. API portfolio architecture analyzes the functionality of the API and organizes, manages and reuses the APIs. API architecture may refer to the design decisions for a particular API proxy. To document the design decisions, API description languages are used. We explain the use of API description languages (RAML and Swagger) on many examples. This book covers all of the above perspectives on API architecture. However, to become useful, the architecture needs to be put into practice. This is why this book covers an API methodology for design and development. An API methodology provides practical guidelines for putting API architecture into practice. It explains how to develop an API architecture into an API that consumers love. A lot of the information on APIs is available on the web. Most of it is published by vendors of API products. I am always a bit suspicious of technical information pushed by product vendors. This book is different. In this book, a product-independent view on API architecture is presented. The API-University Series is a modular series of books on API-related topics. Each book focuses on a particular API topic, so you can select the topics within APIs, which are relevant for you.","language":"en","currency":"USD","id":"150867664X","title":"API Architecture","infoLink":"https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/books\/details?id=6D64DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","authors":["Matthias Biehl"]},{"pageCount":408,"thumbnail":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=ULZTDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","price":22.39,"subtitle":"Efficiently develop, deploy, and manage your enterprise apps on the Amazon Web Services platform","description":"Key concepts, sample applications, best practices, and troubleshooting tips to build highly scalable applications in AWS.

Despite the hype surrounding AI, creating an intelligence that rivals or exceeds human levels is far more complicated than we have been led to believe. Professors Gary Marcus and Ernest Davis have spent their careers at the forefront of AI research and have witnessed some of the greatest milestones in the field, but they argue that a computer beating a human in Jeopardy! does not signal that we are on the doorstep of fully autonomous cars or superintelligent machines. The achievements in the field thus far have occurred in closed systems with fixed sets of rules, and these approaches are too narrow to achieve genuine intelligence. The real world, in contrast, is wildly complex and open-ended. How can we bridge this gap? What will the consequences be when we do? Taking inspiration from the human mind, Marcus and Davis explain what we need to advance AI to the next level, and suggest that if we are wise along the way, we won't need to worry about a future of machine overlords. If we focus on endowing machines with common sense and deep understanding, rather than simply focusing on statistical analysis and gatherine ever larger collections of data, we will be able to create an AI we can trust\u2014in our homes, our cars, and our doctors' offices.

Organizations around the world are looking to exploit the explosive growth of data to unlock previously hidden insights in the hope of creating new revenue streams, gaining operational efficiencies, and obtaining greater understanding of customer needs. It is important to think of big data and analytics together. Big data is the term used to describe the recent explosion of different types of data from disparate sources. Analytics is about examining data to derive interesting and relevant trends and patterns, which can be used to inform decisions, optimize processes, and even drive new business models. With today's deluge of data comes the problems of processing that data, obtaining the correct skills to manage and analyze that data, and establishing rules to govern the data's use and distribution. The big data technology stack is ever growing and sometimes confusing, even more so when we add the complexities of setting up big data environments with large up-front investments. Cloud computing seems to be a perfect vehicle for hosting big data workloads. However, working on big data in the cloud brings its own challenge of reconciling two contradictory design principles.

Organizations around the world are looking to exploit the explosive growth of data to unlock previously hidden insights in the hope of creating new revenue streams, gaining operational efficiencies, and obtaining greater understanding of customer needs. It is important to think of big data and analytics together. Big data is the term used to describe the recent explosion of different types of data from disparate sources. Analytics is about examining data to derive interesting and relevant trends and patterns, which can be used to inform decisions, optimize processes, and even drive new business models. With today's deluge of data comes the problems of processing that data, obtaining the correct skills to manage and analyze that data, and establishing rules to govern the data's use and distribution. The big data technology stack is ever growing and sometimes confusing, even more so when we add the complexities of setting up big data environments with large up-front investments. Cloud computing seems to be a perfect vehicle for hosting big data workloads. However, working on big data in the cloud brings its own challenge of reconciling two contradictory design principles. Cloud computing is based on the concepts of consolidation and resource pooling, but big data systems (such as Hadoop) are built on the shared nothing principle, where each node is independent and self-sufficient.

The lack of portability and interoperability between cloud platforms at different service levels is the main issue affecting cloud-based services today. The brokering, negotiation, management, monitoring and reconfiguration of cloud resources are challenging tasks for developers and users of cloud applications due to the different business models associated with resource consumption, and to the variety of services and features offered by different cloud providers. In chapter 1 the concepts of cloud portability and interoperability are introduced, together with the issues and limitations arising when such features are lacking or ignored. Subsequently, chapter 2 provides an overview of the state-of-the-art methodologies and technologies that are currently used or being explored to enable cloud portability and interoperability. Chapter 3 illustrates the main cross-platform cloud APIs and how they can solve interoperability and portability issues. In turn, chapter 4 presents a set of ready-to-use solutions which, either because of their broad-scale use in cloud computing scenarios or because they utilize established or emerging standards, play a fundamental part in providing interoperable and portable solutions. Lastly, chapter 5 presents an overview of emerging standards for cloud Interoperability and portability.

Whether you are new to GraphQL, or you are an experienced GraphQL developer, this book will provide you with the knowledge needed to get started with AWS AppSync. Do you like learning by doing? After quickly covering the GraphQL foundations, you will dive into the practice of developing APIs with AWS AppSync with in-depth walkthroughs, screenshots, and code samples. Do I learn everything I need to get started? The book guides you through the step-by-step process of designing GraphQL APIs: creating a GraphQL schema, developing GraphQL APIs, connecting data sources, developing resolvers with AppSync templates, securing your API, offering real-time data, developing offline support and synchronization for your apps and much more. Why GraphQL? GraphQL is now a viable option for modern API design. And since Facebook, Yelp, and Shopify have built successful APIs with GraphQL, many companies consider following in the technological footsteps of these tech giants. Using GraphQL is great, but by itself, it is only half the rent: It requires the manual installation and maintenance of software infrastructure components. Why Serverless GraphQL with AppSync? AppSync is a cloud-based platform for GraphQL APIs. It is serverless, so you waste no time setting up infrastructure. It scales up and down dynamically depending on the load. It supports your app developers with an SDK for synchronization and offline support. You pay only what you use, so no upfront investment is needed and it may save your organizations thousands of dollars in IT costs.","language":"en","currency":"USD","id":"1717110703","title":"Serverless GraphQL APIs with Amazon\u2019s AWS AppSync","infoLink":"https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/books\/details?id=7D64DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","authors":["Matthias Biehl"]},{"pageCount":280,"thumbnail":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=31MoDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","price":19.79,"subtitle":null,"description":"Discover the definitive guide to crafting lightning-fast data processing for distributed systems with Apache Flink About This Book Build your expertize in processing real-time data with Apache Flink and its ecosystem Gain insights into the working of all components of Apache Flink such as FlinkML, Gelly, and Table API filled with real world use cases Exploit Apache Flink's capabilities like distributed data streaming, in-memory processing, pipelining and iteration operators to improve performance.
