It examines four main aspects of the application of semantics to systems, specifically: How do we infer meaning from unstructured information, how do application systems make meaning as they operate, how do practitioners uncover meaning in business settings, and how do we understand and communicate what we have deduced? This book illustrates how this applies to the future of application system development, especially how it informs and affects Web services and business rule- based approaches, and how semantics will play out with XML and the semantic Web. The book also contains a quick reference guide to related terms and technologies. It is part of Morgan Kaufmann's series of Savvy Manager's Guides. * Presents an easy and enjoyable introduction to semantics in the context of business IT systems. * Articulates the business value of semantics, while providing relevant introductory technical background. * Describes the semantic underpinnings of data modeling, business rules, enterprise integration, and Web services. * Contains a handy quick-reference guide to technologies and terminology. * For more information, links, and discussions, go to www.savvymanagers.com.","language":"en","currency":"USD","id":"0080498124","title":"Semantics in Business Systems","infoLink":"https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/books\/details?id=Udcmh_k8HMYC&source=gbs_api","authors":["Dave McComb"]},{"pageCount":456,"thumbnail":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=_VfAAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","price":0,"subtitle":null,"description":"This IBM® Redbooks® publication describes IBM DB2® SQL compatibility features. The latest version of DB2 includes extensive native support for the PL\/SQL procedural language, new data types, scalar functions, improved concurrency, built-in packages, OCI, SQLPlus, and more. These features can help with developing applications that run on both DB2 and Oracle and can help simplify the process of moving from Oracle to DB2. In addition, IBM now provides tools to simplify the enablement process, such as the highly scalable IBM Data Movement Tool for moving schema and data into DB2, and an Editor and Profiler for PL\/SQL provided by the IBM Data Studio tool suite. This Oracle to DB2 migration guide describes new technology, preferred practices for moving to DB2, and common scenarios that can help you as you move from Oracle to DB2. This book is intended for IT architects and developers who are converting from Oracle to DB2. DB2 compatibility with Oracle is provided through native support. The new capabilities in DB2 that provide compatibility are implemented at the lowest and most intimate levels of the database kernel, as though they were originally engineered for DB2. means that the DB2 implementation is done without the aid of an emulation layer. This intimacy leads to the scalable implementation that DB2 offers, providing identical performance between DB2 compatibility features and DB2 other language elements.

The book guides you through the step-by-step process of designing GraphQL APIs: creating a GraphQL schema, developing GraphQL APIs, connecting data sources, developing resolvers with AppSync templates, securing your API, offering real-time data, developing offline support and synchronization for your apps and much more. Why GraphQL? GraphQL is now a viable option for modern API design. And since Facebook, Yelp, and Shopify have built successful APIs with GraphQL, many companies consider following in the technological footsteps of these tech giants. Using GraphQL is great, but by itself, it is only half the rent: It requires the manual installation and maintenance of software infrastructure components. Why Serverless GraphQL with AppSync? AppSync is a cloud-based platform for GraphQL APIs. It is serverless, so you waste no time setting up infrastructure. It scales up and down dynamically depending on the load. It supports your app developers with an SDK for synchronization and offline support.

In this book you will begin by installing and configuring PostgreSQL on a server by focusing on system-level parameter settings before installation. You will also look at key post-installation steps to avoid issues in the future. The basic configuration of PostgreSQL is tuned for compatibility rather than performance. Keeping this in mind, you will fine-tune your PostgreSQL parameters based on your environment and application behavior. You will then get tips to improve database monitoring and maintenance followed by database security for handling sensitive data in PostgreSQL. Every system containing valuable data needs to be backed-up regularly. PostgreSQL follows a simple back-up procedure and provides fundamental approaches to back up your data. You will go through these approaches and choose the right one based on your environment. Running your application with limited resources can be tricky. To achieve this you will implement a pooling mechanism for your PostgreSQL instances to connect to other databases. Finally, you will take a look at some basic errors faced while working with PostgreSQL and learn to resolve them in the quickest manner.

Whether you are new to GraphQL, or you are an experienced GraphQL developer, this book will provide you with the knowledge needed to get started with AWS AppSync. Do you like learning by doing? After quickly covering the GraphQL foundations, you will dive into the practice of developing APIs with AWS AppSync with in-depth walkthroughs, screenshots, and code samples. Do I learn everything I need to get started? The book guides you through the step-by-step process of designing GraphQL APIs: creating a GraphQL schema, developing GraphQL APIs, connecting data sources, developing resolvers with AppSync templates, securing your API, offering real-time data, developing offline support and synchronization for your apps and much more. Why GraphQL? GraphQL is now a viable option for modern API design. And since Facebook, Yelp, and Shopify have built successful APIs with GraphQL, many companies consider following in the technological footsteps of these tech giants. Using GraphQL is great, but by itself, it is only half the rent: It requires the manual installation and maintenance of software infrastructure components. Why Serverless GraphQL with AppSync? AppSync is a cloud-based platform for GraphQL APIs. It is serverless, so you waste no time setting up infrastructure. It scales up and down dynamically depending on the load. It supports your app developers with an SDK for synchronization and offline support. You pay only what you use, so no upfront investment is needed and it may save your organizations thousands of dollars in IT costs.","language":"en","currency":"USD","id":"1717110703","title":"Serverless GraphQL APIs with Amazon\u2019s AWS AppSync","infoLink":"https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/books\/details?id=7D64DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","authors":["Matthias Biehl"]},{"pageCount":280,"thumbnail":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=31MoDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","price":19.79,"subtitle":null,"description":"Discover the definitive guide to crafting lightning-fast data processing for distributed systems with Apache Flink About This Book Build your expertize in processing real-time data with Apache Flink and its ecosystem Gain insights into the working of all components of Apache Flink such as FlinkML, Gelly, and Table API filled with real world use cases Exploit Apache Flink's capabilities like distributed data streaming, in-memory processing, pipelining and iteration operators to improve performance.
