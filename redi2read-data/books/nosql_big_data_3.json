Multi-tiered object-oriented platforms, such as Java and .NET, have become commonplace. These new tools and technologies are capable of building powerful applications, but they are not easily implemented. Common failures in enterprise applications often occur because their developers do not understand the architectural lessons that experienced object developers have learned. Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture is written in direct response to the stiff challenges that face enterprise application developers. The author, noted object-oriented designer Martin Fowler, noticed that despite changes in technology--from Smalltalk to CORBA to Java to .NET--the same basic design ideas can be adapted and applied to solve common problems. With the help of an expert group of contributors, Martin distills over forty recurring solutions into patterns. The result is an indispensable handbook of solutions that are applicable to any enterprise application platform. This book is actually two books in one. The first section is a short tutorial on developing enterprise applications, which you can read from start to finish to understand the scope of the book's lessons. The next section, the bulk of the book, is a detailed reference to the patterns themselves. Each pattern provides usage and implementation information, as well as detailed code examples in Java or C#. The entire book is also richly illustrated with UML diagrams to further explain the concepts. Armed with this book, you will have the knowledge necessary to make important architectural decisions about building an enterprise application and the proven patterns for use when building them. The topics covered include ¬∑ Dividing an enterprise application into layers ¬∑ The major approaches to organizing business logic ¬∑ An in-depth treatment of mapping between objects and relational databases ¬∑ Using Model-View-Controller to organize a Web presentation ¬∑ Handling concurrency for data that spans multiple transactions ¬∑ Designing distributed object interfaces","language":"en","currency":"USD","id":"0133065219","title":"Fowler","infoLink":"https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/books\/details?id=vqTfNFDzzdIC&source=gbs_api","authors":["Martin Fowler"]},{"pageCount":504,"thumbnail":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=8AcvDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","price":17.99,"subtitle":"Practical Programming for Total Beginners","description":"If you\u2019ve ever spent hours renaming files or updating hundreds of spreadsheet cells, you know how tedious tasks like these can be.

Because the computer gathers knowledge from experience, there is no need for a human computer operator to formally specify all the knowledge that the computer needs. The hierarchy of concepts allows the computer to learn complicated concepts by building them out of simpler ones; a graph of these hierarchies would be many layers deep.

The text offers mathematical and conceptual background, covering relevant concepts in linear algebra, probability theory and information theory, numerical computation, and machine learning. It describes deep learning techniques used by practitioners in industry, including deep feedforward networks, regularization, optimization algorithms, convolutional networks, sequence modeling, and practical methodology; and it surveys such applications as natural language processing, speech recognition, computer vision, online recommendation systems, bioinformatics, and videogames. Finally, the book offers research perspectives, covering such theoretical topics as linear factor models, autoencoders, representation learning, structured probabilistic models, Monte Carlo methods, the partition function, approximate inference, and deep generative models.

The process is systematic and does away with the fuzziness associated with existing techniques. Thus, consolidation is treated as a requirements engineering issue. The notion of a decision occupies a central position in the decision-based approach. On one hand, information relevant to a decision must be elicited from stakeholders; modeled; and transformed into multi-dimensional form. On the other, decisions themselves are to be obtained from decision applications. For the former, the authors introduce a suite of information elicitation techniques specific to data warehousing. This information is subsequently converted into multi-dimensional form. For the latter, not only are decisions obtained from decision applications for managing operational businesses, but also from applications for formulating business policies and for defining rules for enforcing policies, respectively. In this context, the book presents a broad range of models, tools and techniques.

Processing the enormous quantities of data necessary for these advances requires large clusters, making distributed computing paradigms more crucial than ever. MapReduce is a programming model for expressing distributed computations on massive datasets and an execution framework for large-scale data processing on clusters of commodity servers. The programming model provides an easy-to-understand abstraction for designing scalable algorithms, while the execution framework transparently handles many system-level details, ranging from scheduling to synchronization to fault tolerance. This book focuses on MapReduce algorithm design, with an emphasis on text processing algorithms common in natural language processing, information retrieval, and machine learning. We introduce the notion of MapReduce design patterns, which represent general reusable solutions to commonly occurring problems across a variety of problem domains. This book not only intends to help the reader \"think in MapReduce\", but also discusses limitations of the programming model as well.

Because the computer gathers knowledge from experience, there is no need for a human computer operator to formally specify all the knowledge that the computer needs. The hierarchy of concepts allows the computer to learn complicated concepts by building them out of simpler ones; a graph of these hierarchies would be many layers deep.

The text offers mathematical and conceptual background, covering relevant concepts in linear algebra, probability theory and information theory, numerical computation, and machine learning. It describes deep learning techniques used by practitioners in industry, including deep feedforward networks, regularization, optimization algorithms, convolutional networks, sequence modeling, and practical methodology; and it surveys such applications as natural language processing, speech recognition, computer vision, online recommendation systems, bioinformatics, and videogames. Finally, the book offers research perspectives, covering such theoretical topics as linear factor models, autoencoders, representation learning, structured probabilistic models, Monte Carlo methods, the partition function, approximate inference, and deep generative models.

The process is systematic and does away with the fuzziness associated with existing techniques. Thus, consolidation is treated as a requirements engineering issue. The notion of a decision occupies a central position in the decision-based approach. On one hand, information relevant to a decision must be elicited from stakeholders; modeled; and transformed into multi-dimensional form. On the other, decisions themselves are to be obtained from decision applications. For the former, the authors introduce a suite of information elicitation techniques specific to data warehousing. This information is subsequently converted into multi-dimensional form. For the latter, not only are decisions obtained from decision applications for managing operational businesses, but also from applications for formulating business policies and for defining rules for enforcing policies, respectively.

Processing the enormous quantities of data necessary for these advances requires large clusters, making distributed computing paradigms more crucial than ever. MapReduce is a programming model for expressing distributed computations on massive datasets and an execution framework for large-scale data processing on clusters of commodity servers. The programming model provides an easy-to-understand abstraction for designing scalable algorithms, while the execution framework transparently handles many system-level details, ranging from scheduling to synchronization to fault tolerance. This book focuses on MapReduce algorithm design, with an emphasis on text processing algorithms common in natural language processing, information retrieval, and machine learning. We introduce the notion of MapReduce design patterns, which represent general reusable solutions to commonly occurring problems across a variety of problem domains. This book not only intends to help the reader \"think in MapReduce\", but also discusses limitations of the programming model as well.

Because the computer gathers knowledge from experience, there is no need for a human computer operator to formally specify all the knowledge that the computer needs. The hierarchy of concepts allows the computer to learn complicated concepts by building them out of simpler ones; a graph of these hierarchies would be many layers deep.

The text offers mathematical and conceptual background, covering relevant concepts in linear algebra, probability theory and information theory, numerical computation, and machine learning. It describes deep learning techniques used by practitioners in industry, including deep feedforward networks, regularization, optimization algorithms, convolutional networks, sequence modeling, and practical methodology; and it surveys such applications as natural language processing, speech recognition, computer vision, online recommendation systems, bioinformatics, and videogames. Finally, the book offers research perspectives, covering such theoretical topics as linear factor models, autoencoders, representation learning, structured probabilistic models, Monte Carlo methods, the partition function, approximate inference, and deep generative models.

The process is systematic and does away with the fuzziness associated with existing techniques. Thus, consolidation is treated as a requirements engineering issue. The notion of a decision occupies a central position in the decision-based approach. On one hand, information relevant to a decision must be elicited from stakeholders; modeled; and transformed into multi-dimensional form. On the other, decisions themselves are to be obtained from decision applications. For the former, the authors introduce a suite of information elicitation techniques specific to data warehousing. This information is subsequently converted into multi-dimensional form. For the latter, not only are decisions obtained from decision applications for managing operational businesses, but also from applications for formulating business policies and for defining rules for enforcing policies, respectively.

Processing the enormous quantities of data necessary for these advances requires large clusters, making distributed computing paradigms more crucial than ever. MapReduce is a programming model for expressing distributed computations on massive datasets and an execution framework for large-scale data processing on clusters of commodity servers. The programming model provides an easy-to-understand abstraction for designing scalable algorithms, while the execution framework transparently handles many system-level details, ranging from scheduling to synchronization to fault tolerance. This book focuses on MapReduce algorithm design, with an emphasis on text processing algorithms common in natural language processing, information retrieval, and machine learning. We introduce the notion of MapReduce design patterns, which represent general reusable solutions to commonly occurring problems across a variety of problem domains. This book not only intends to help the reader \"think in MapReduce\", but also discusses limitations of the programming model as well.

Because the computer gathers knowledge from experience, there is no need for a human computer operator to formally specify all the knowledge that the computer needs. The hierarchy of concepts allows the computer to learn complicated concepts by building them out of simpler ones; a graph of these hierarchies would be many layers deep.

The text offers mathematical and conceptual background, covering relevant concepts in linear algebra, probability theory and information theory, numerical computation, and machine learning. It describes deep learning techniques used by practitioners in industry, including deep feedforward networks, regularization, optimization algorithms, convolutional networks, sequence modeling, and practical methodology; and it surveys such applications as natural language processing, speech recognition, computer vision, online recommendation systems, bioinformatics, and videogames. Finally, the book offers research perspectives, covering such theoretical topics as linear factor models, autoencoders, representation learning, structured probabilistic models, Monte Carlo methods, the partition function, approximate inference, and deep generative models.

The process is systematic and does away with the fuzziness associated with existing techniques. Thus, consolidation is treated as a requirements engineering issue. The notion of a decision occupies a central position in the decision-based approach. On one hand, information relevant to a decision must be elicited from stakeholders; modeled; and transformed into multi-dimensional form. On the other, decisions themselves are to be obtained from decision applications. For the former, the authors introduce a suite of information elicitation techniques specific to data warehousing. This information is subsequently converted into multi-dimensional form. For the latter, not only are decisions obtained from decision applications for managing operational businesses, but also from applications for formulating business policies and for defining rules for enforcing policies, respectively. In this context, the book presents a broad range of models, tools and techniques.

Processing the enormous quantities of data necessary for these advances requires large clusters, making distributed computing paradigms more crucial than ever. MapReduce is a programming model for expressing distributed computations on massive datasets and an execution framework for large-scale data processing on clusters of commodity servers. The programming model provides an easy-to-understand abstraction for designing scalable algorithms, while the execution framework transparently handles many system-level details, ranging from scheduling to synchronization to fault tolerance. This book focuses on MapReduce algorithm design, with an emphasis on text processing algorithms common in natural language processing, information retrieval, and machine learning. We introduce the notion of MapReduce design patterns, which represent general reusable solutions to commonly occurring problems across a variety of problem domains. This book not only intends to help the reader \"think in MapReduce\", but also discusses limitations of the programming model as well. This volume is a printed version of a work that appears in the Synthesis Digital Library of Engineering and Computer Science.
