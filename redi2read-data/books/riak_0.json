NoSQL Distilled is a concise but thorough introduction to this rapidly emerging technology. Pramod J. Sadalage and Martin Fowler explain how NoSQL databases work and the ways that they may be a superior alternative to a traditional RDBMS. The authors provide a fast-paced guide to the concepts you need to know in order to evaluate whether NoSQL databases are right for your needs and, if so, which technologies you should explore further. The first part of the book concentrates on core concepts, including schemaless data models, aggregates, new distribution models, the CAP theorem, and map-reduce. In the second part, the authors explore architectural and design issues associated with implementing NoSQL. They also present realistic use cases that demonstrate NoSQL databases at work and feature representative examples using Riak, MongoDB, Cassandra, and Neo4j. In addition, by drawing on Pramod Sadalage\u2019s pioneering work, NoSQL Distilled shows how to implement evolutionary design with schema migration: an essential technique for applying NoSQL databases.

Im Vergleich zu modernen Konzepten können relationale Datenbanken als wichtigster Stellvertreter für ``traditionelle Technologien'' bezeichnet werden. Wenn man als Entwickler zu Seiten wie Google.com, Facebook.com, Amazon.com, Digg.com, Ebay.com, Yahoo.com, Twitter.com oder Dawanda.com surft, wird meist angenommen, dass eine verteilte relationale Datenbank verwendet wird. Die Annahme ist zu 50% richtig, jedoch ist die Datenhaltung meist nicht relational. Diese Großunternehmen verwalten mehrere hundert Gigabytes, bis hin zu 100.000 Gigabyte an Daten, und mussten in den letzten sechs Jahren Lösungen finden, um erfolgreich diese riesigen Datenmengen zu beherrschen. Google erfand vor ca. sieben Jahren ein Verfahren, um Datenmengen im Petabytebereich zu beherrschen. Facebook entwickelte selbst eine Datenbanktechnologie, um die Posteingänge von Benutzern verfügbar zu machen, Twitter.com adaptiert diese Technologie für andere Zwecke. Amazon.com entwickelte \"Dynamo'', um Hochverfügbarkeit für deren weltgrößte E-Commerce Plattform zu schaffen. Diese und andere Eigenentwicklungen entstanden aus der Notwendigkeit heraus, riesige Datenmengen bzw. Datenbanken hoch verfügbar, konsistent und skalierbar zu machen. Seit den letzten drei Jahren sind alternative \"Open-Source-Implementierungen'' dieser Entwicklungen entstanden. Die Veröffentlichung der Konzepte und Technologien führten zu einer ganzen Bewegung namens \"NoSQL''. Sind diese Konzepte vorteilhafter, um eine bessere und für Entwickler einfachere Skalierung, Abfragemöglichkeit und Datenkonsistenz in einem hochverfügbaren Datenbanksystem, zu gewährleisten? Wie werden komplexe Abfragen in modernen und traditionellen verteilten Systemen gemacht und wie werden diese ausgeführt? Speziell stellt sich die Frage, ob das MapReduce Verfahren ein vollständiger Ersatz für SQL ist. Für welche Einsatzzwecke sind beide besonders gut geeignet und für welche weniger? Ausgewählte Konzepte moderner, verteilter Datenbanksysteme sind zentrale Bestandteile dieser Arbeit. Dazu werden die Eigenschaften Verfügbarkeit, Konsistenz und Skalierbarkeit in den verteilten Systemen ausführlicher beschrieben, um zu analysieren, ob gegenüber relationalen Datenbanken Vorteile und Nachteile dieser Eigenschaften existieren. Ergebnisse dieser Aufgabenstellung sollen Chancen und Risiken von modernen Datenbanken aufdecken. Key-Value-Stores sind die einfachsten Vertreter moderner Datenbanken. \"Riak'' wird in dieser Arbeit als Implementierung moderner Konzepte benutzt. \"MySQL'' soll als Vertreter für relationale Datenbanken verwendet werden da dieser Vertreter eine weit verbreitete Open-Source-Implementierung von relationalen Datenbanken ist. Andere Datenbankkonzepte\/Datenbanken werden in dieser Arbeit nicht behandelt. Dazu zählen unter anderem objektorientierte, objektrelationale, hierarchische, spaltenorientierte und graphenorientierte Datenbankformen, sowie Repräsentanten von relationalen Datenbanken, wie \"db2'', \"Sybase'' oder \"Oracle'', da diese nicht Open-Source sind. Das konsistente Hashfunktionsverfahren wird zuerst kurz erläutert, um theoretische Grundlagen für die Implementierung moderner und traditioneller Skalierungsmethoden zu legen. Danach werden, im Kontext moderner Datenbanktechnologien, wichtige theoretische Konzepte zur Skalierung erläutert. Dazu werden die drei wichtigsten Eigenschaften verteilter Systeme definiert und in Zusammenhang gebracht (Verfügbarkeit, Konsistenz und Partitionstoleranz). Dementsprechend wird das Prinzip \"letztendliche Konsistenz'' vorgestellt, welches eine zentrale Rolle bei modernen verteilten Systemen darstellt. Weiterhin wird das MapReduce-Verfahren konzeptionell vorgestellt. Es wird aus zwei Perspektiven betrachtet: Filterung von Daten durch benutzerdefinierte Funktionen anhand eines Beispiels und in diesem Zusammenhang die Ausführung des Verfahrens in verteilten Systemen. Implementierungen dieser theoretischen Ansätze werden in diesem Kapitel aufgelistet. Eine detaillierte Beschreibung von \"Key-Value-Stores'' (KVS) wird im nächsten Kapitel bereitgestellt. KVS sind die einfachste Form von modernen Datenbanken, an denen sich die grundlegenden Konzepte abstrakt beschreiben lassen. \"Riak'' ist ein wichtiger Vertreter für moderne Datenbanken und KVS. Die theoretischen Grundlagen der drei zentralen Eigenschaften verteilter System werden an dieser direkten Implementierung gefestigt und erweitert. Dem folgt eine kurze Vorstellung von relationalen Datenbanken. Dabei wird ausschließlich auf Möglichkeiten zur Skalierung eingegangen. Im letzten Kapitel werden zuerst beide Datenbanktechnologien hinsichtlich der Skalierung, Konsistenz, Verfügbarkeit und Komplexität verglichen. Weiterhin findet ein Vergleich zwischen MapReduce und SQL bzw. \"benutzerdefinierten Funktionen'' anhand von Einsatzmöglichkeiten, Stabilität und Komplexität statt. Der Vergleich von MySQL und Riak erfolgt durch eine Analyse der Abfragemöglichkeiten mittels Stored Procedures und MapReduce anhand mehrerer Beispiele. Hierbei sollen die zentralen Fragestellungen beantwortet werden. Abschließend werden die Ergebnisse zusammengefasst und bewertet.","language":"de","currency":"USD","id":"3842856792","title":"Vergleich und Evaluation zwischen modernen und traditionellen Datenbankkonzepten unter den Gesichtspunkten Skalierung, Abfragem\u201Dglichkeit und Konsistenz","infoLink":"https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/books\/details?id=6-M_eVneQxYC&source=gbs_api","authors":["Nils Petersohn"]},{"pageCount":83,"thumbnail":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=BuHEWIjNEysC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","price":0,"subtitle":null,"description":"In an age where everything is measurable, understanding big data is an essential.

It is the book to help you choose the correct database technology at a time when concepts such as Big Data, NoSQL and NewSQL are making what used to be an easy choice into a complex decision with significant implications. The relational database (RDBMS) model completely dominated database technology for over 20 years. Today this \"one size fits all\" stability has been disrupted by a relatively recent explosion of new database technologies. These paradigm-busting technologies are powering the \"Big Data\" and \"NoSQL\" revolutions, as well as forcing fundamental changes in databases across the board. Deciding to use a relational database was once truly a no-brainer, and the various commercial relational databases competed on price, performance, reliability, and ease of use rather than on fundamental architectures. Today we are faced with choices between radically different database technologies. Choosing the right database today is a complex undertaking, with serious economic and technological consequences. Next Generation Databases demystifies today\u2019s new database technologies. The book describes what each technology was designed to solve.

Organizations around the world are looking to exploit the explosive growth of data to unlock previously hidden insights in the hope of creating new revenue streams, gaining operational efficiencies, and obtaining greater understanding of customer needs. It is important to think of big data and analytics together. Big data is the term used to describe the recent explosion of different types of data from disparate sources. Analytics is about examining data to derive interesting and relevant trends and patterns, which can be used to inform decisions, optimize processes, and even drive new business models. With today's deluge of data comes the problems of processing that data, obtaining the correct skills to manage and analyze that data, and establishing rules to govern the data's use and distribution. The big data technology stack is ever growing and sometimes confusing, even more so when we add the complexities of setting up big data environments with large up-front investments. Cloud computing seems to be a perfect vehicle for hosting big data workloads. However, working on big data in the cloud brings its own challenge of reconciling two contradictory design principles. Cloud computing is based on the concepts of consolidation and resource pooling, but big data systems (such as Hadoop) are built on the shared nothing principle, where each node is independent and self-sufficient. A solution architecture that can allow these mutually exclusive principles to coexist is required to truly exploit the elasticity and ease-of-use of cloud computing for big data environments. This IBM® RedpaperTM publication is aimed at chief architects, line-of-business executives, and CIOs to provide an understanding of the cloud-related challenges they face and give prescriptive guidance for how to realize the benefits of big data solutions quickly and cost-effectively.","language":"en","currency":"USD","id":"0738453994","title":"Building Big Data and Analytics Solutions in the Cloud","infoLink":"https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/books\/details?id=dGu-BQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","authors":["Wei-Dong Zhu","Manav Gupta","Ven Kumar","Sujatha Perepa","Arvind Sathi","Craig Statchuk","IBM Redbooks"]},{"pageCount":256,"thumbnail":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=UEOZBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","price":15.39,"subtitle":"Mongo, Express, AngularJS, and Node.js","description":"Traditionally, web applications have been architected so that the back-end houses all the front-end code.

Second, most books try to use SQL as a vehicle for teaching relational theory, but this book deliberately takes the opposite approach. Its primary aim is to teach relational theory as such. Then it uses that theory as a vehicle for teaching SQL, showing in particular how that theory can help with the practical problem of using SQL correctly and productively.

You need a powerful, industrial-strength tool to handle the really hard problems inherent in parallel, concurrent environments. You need Erlang. In this second edition of the bestselling Programming Erlang, you'll learn how to write parallel programs that scale effortlessly on multicore systems. Using Erlang, you'll be surprised at how easy it becomes to deal with parallel problems, and how much faster and more efficiently your programs run. That's because Erlang uses sets of parallel processes-not a single sequential process, as found in most programming languages. Joe Armstrong, creator of Erlang, introduces this powerful language in small steps, giving you a complete overview of Erlang and how to use it in common scenarios. You'll start with sequential programming, move to parallel programming and handling errors in parallel programs, and learn to work confidently with distributed programming and the standard Erlang\/Open Telecom Platform (OTP) frameworks. You need no previous knowledge of functional or parallel programming. The chapters are packed with hands-on, real-world tutorial examples and insider tips and advice, and finish with exercises for both beginning and advanced users. The second edition has been extensively rewritten. New to this edition are seven chapters covering the latest Erlang features: maps, the type system and the Dialyzer, WebSockets, programming idioms, and a new stand-alone execution environment. You'll write programs that dynamically detect and correct errors, and that can be upgraded without stopping the system. There's also coverage of rebar (the de facto Erlang build system), and information on how to share and use Erlang projects on github, illustrated with examples from cowboy and bitcask.

For decades OTP has helped developers create incredibly robust, scalable applications with unparalleled uptime. Make the most of them as you build a stateful web app with Elixir, OTP, and Phoenix. Model domain entities without an ORM or a database. Manage server state and keep your code clean with OTP Behaviours. Layer on a Phoenix web interface without coupling it to the business logic. Open doors to powerful new techniques that will get you thinking about web development in fundamentally new ways. Elixir and OTP provide exceptional tools to build rock-solid back-end applications that scale. In this book, you'll build a web application in a radically different way, with a back end that holds application state. You'll use persistent Phoenix Channel connections instead of HTTP's request-response, and create the full application in distinct, decoupled layers. In Part 1, start by building the business logic as a separate application, without Phoenix. Model the application domain with Elixir functions and simple data structures. By keeping state in memory instead of a database, you can reduce latency and simplify your code. In Part 2, add in the GenServer Behaviour to make managing in-memory state a breeze. Create a supervision tree to boost fault tolerance while separating error handling from business logic. Phoenix is a modern web framework you can layer on top of business logic while keeping the two completely decoupled. In Part 3, you'll do exactly that as you build a web interface with Phoenix. Bring in the application from Part 2 as a dependency to a new Phoenix project. Then use ultra-scalable Phoenix Channels to establish persistent connections between the stateful server and a stateful front-end client. You're going to love this way of building web apps! What You Need: You'll need a computer that can run Elixir version 1.5 or higher and Phoenix 1.3 or higher.

Database performance has become a major headache, and most IT departments believe that developers should provide simple SQL code to solve immediate problems and let DBAs tune any \"bad SQL\" later. In The Art of SQL, author and SQL expert Stephane Faroult argues that this \"safe approach\" only leads to disaster. His insightful book, named after Art of War by Sun Tzu, contends that writing quick inefficient code is sweeping the dirt under the rug. SQL code may run for 5 to 10 years, surviving several major releases of the database management system and on several generations of hardware. The code must be fast and sound from the start, and that requires a firm understanding of SQL and relational theory. The Art of SQL offers best practices that teach experienced SQL users to focus on strategy rather than specifics. Faroult's approach takes a page from Sun Tzu's classic treatise by viewing database design as a military campaign. You need knowledge, skills, and talent. Talent can't be taught, but every strategist from Sun Tzu to modern-day generals believed that it can be nurtured through the experience of others. They passed on their experience acquired in the field through basic principles that served as guiding stars amid the sound and fury of battle. This is what Faroult does with SQL. Like a successful battle plan, good architectural choices are based on contingencies. What if the volume of this or that table increases unexpectedly? What if, following a merger, the number of users doubles? What if you want to keep several years of data online? Faroult's way of looking at SQL performance may be unconventional and unique, but he's deadly serious about writing good SQL and using SQL well. The Art of SQL is not a cookbook, listing problems and giving recipes.

Throughout all this change, the basic principles that shape the architecture of data have remained the same. There remains a need for people to take a look at the \"bigger picture\" and to understand where their data fit into the grand scheme of things. Data Architecture: A Primer for the Data Scientist, Second Edition addresses the larger architectural picture of how big data fits within the existing information infrastructure or data warehousing systems. This is an essential topic not only for data scientists, analysts, and managers but also for researchers and engineers who increasingly need to deal with large and complex sets of data. Until data are gathered and can be placed into an existing framework or architecture, they cannot be used to their full potential. Drawing upon years of practical experience and using numerous examples and case studies from across various industries, the authors seek to explain this larger picture into which big data fits, giving data scientists the necessary context for how pieces of the puzzle should fit together.

You will learn how to make a scatter plot, a bar graph, a pie chart, a force directed graph, and a map. Key Features Takes you through the most common graphs you'll need Add interactivity to your visualizations Easy to follow builds Book Description D3.js is a JavaScript library that allows you to create graphs and data visualizations in the browser with HTML, SVG, and CSS. This book will take you from the basics of D3.js, so that you can create your own interactive visualizations, to creating the most common graphs that you will encounter as a developer, scientist, statistician, or data scientist. The book begins with an overview of SVG, the basis for creating two-dimensional graphics in the browser. Once the reader has a firm understanding of SVG, we will tackle the basics of how to use D3.js to connect data to our SVG elements. We will start with a scatter plot that maps run data to circles on a graph, and expand our scatter plot to make it interactive. You will see how you can easily allow the users of your graph to create, edit, and delete run data by simply dragging and clicking the graph. Next, we will explore creating a bar graph, using external data from a mock API. After that, we will explore animations and motion with a bar graph, and use various physics-based forces to create a force-directed graph. Finally, we will look at how to use GeoJSON data to create a map.
