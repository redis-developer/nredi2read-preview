Database performance has become a major headache, and most IT departments believe that developers should provide simple SQL code to solve immediate problems and let DBAs tune any \"bad SQL\" later. In The Art of SQL, author and SQL expert Stephane Faroult argues that this \"safe approach\" only leads to disaster. His insightful book, named after Art of War by Sun Tzu, contends that writing quick inefficient code is sweeping the dirt under the rug. SQL code may run for 5 to 10 years, surviving several major releases of the database management system and on several generations of hardware. The code must be fast and sound from the start, and that requires a firm understanding of SQL and relational theory. The Art of SQL offers best practices that teach experienced SQL users to focus on strategy rather than specifics. Faroult's approach takes a page from Sun Tzu's classic treatise by viewing database design as a military campaign. You need knowledge, skills, and talent. Talent can't be taught, but every strategist from Sun Tzu to modern-day generals believed that it can be nurtured through the experience of others. They passed on their experience acquired in the field through basic principles that served as guiding stars amid the sound and fury of battle. This is what Faroult does with SQL. Like a successful battle plan, good architectural choices are based on contingencies. What if the volume of this or that table increases unexpectedly? What if, following a merger, the number of users doubles? What if you want to keep several years of data online? Faroult's way of looking at SQL performance may be unconventional and unique, but he's deadly serious about writing good SQL and using SQL well. The Art of SQL is not a cookbook, listing problems and giving recipes. The aim is to get you-and your manager-to raise good questions.","language":"en","currency":"USD","id":"9780596555368","title":"The Art of SQL","infoLink":"https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/books\/details?id=HfcMDvxb43AC&source=gbs_api","authors":["Stephane Faroult","Peter Robson"]},{"pageCount":352,"thumbnail":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=T9iPeex6W9sC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","price":51.99,"subtitle":null,"description":"Expert Oracle GoldenGate is a hands-on guide to creating and managing complex data replication environments using the latest in database replication technology from Oracle.

Social websites, evolving around the connections between people and their objects of interest, are encountering boundaries in the areas of information integration, dissemination, reuse, portability, searchability, automation and demanding tasks like querying. The Semantic Web is an ideal platform for interlinking and performing operations on diverse person- and object-related data available from the Social Web, and has produced a variety of approaches to overcome the boundaries being experienced in Social Web application areas. After a short overview of both the Social Web and the Semantic Web, Breslin et al. describe some popular social media and social networking applications, list their strengths and limitations, and describe some applications of Semantic Web technology to address their current shortcomings by enhancing them with semantics. Across these social websites, they demonstrate a twofold approach for interconnecting the islands that are social websites with semantic technologies, and for powering semantic applications with rich community-created content. They conclude with observations on how the application of Semantic Web technologies to the Social Web is leading towards the \"Social Semantic Web\" (sometimes also called \"Web 3.0\"), forming a network of interlinked and semantically-rich content and knowledge. The book is intended for computer science professionals, researchers, and graduates interested in understanding the technologies and research issues involved in applying Semantic Web technologies to social software.

Fachhochschule Frankfurt am Main, Sprache: Deutsch, Abstract: Für viele Unternehmen sind sie elementar wichtig, für Benutzer von Smartphones, Social Media-Anwendungen, Online-Shops sowie diverser Plattformen sind sie dagegen nicht von großer Bedeutung. Die Rede ist von \"Daten\". Da Daten aus Unternehmenssicht wichtige Informationen, wie zum Beispiel das Kaufverhalten eines Kunden reflektieren, spielen sie heutzutage eine wichtige Rolle bei der Gewinngenerierung. Beispielsweise versuchen Unternehmen anhand von verschiedenen BI-Lösungen, diese gespeicherten Daten auszuwerten, um eine Gewinnmaximierung zu erzielen. Laut der Digital-Universe-Studie von IDC verdoppelt sich der komplette Datenbestand alle zweieinhalb Jahre und soll im Jahre 2020 in Westeuropa auf fünf Zetabyte anwachsen. Die Studie besagt zudem, dass das Datenvolumen 2020 auf dem gesamten Globus 44 Zetabyte betragen wird. An einigen Beispielen lässt sich der explosiv wachsende Datenbestand aufzeigen: (1) Derzeit wären acht Jahre nötig, um alle Videos in YouTube, die täglich hochgeladen werden, anzuschauen. (2) Es werden in Facebook pro Minute 2,46 Millionen Inhalte geteilt. (3) Die Summe der Datensätze ist aktuell größer als die Zahl aller Sterne im Universum. Solch große Datenansammlungen, die aufgrund des Web 2.0 entstanden sind, brachten vor einigen Jahren das Trendwort \"BIG DATA\" hervor. Die Entwicklung von Big Data brachte vielen Unternehmen nicht nur profitable Informationen, sondern ließ auch deren Datenbanken und Datenbank-Management-Systeme an ihre Grenzen stoßen. Herausforderungen, wie z. B. die schnelle Verarbeitung vieler Datensätze, sind aufgrund der Komplexität und der Datenstruktur von relationalen Datenbank-Management-Systemen nicht mehr leicht zu bewältigen. Diese Herausforderungen stießen den Durchbruch der NoSQL-Datenbanken an.

As such, it is not a replacement for a classical textbook (i.e., it does not elaborate on fundamentals of methods and principles described elsewhere), but systematically highlights the connection between theory, on the one hand, and its application in specific use cases, on the other. With these goals in mind, the book is divided into three parts: Part I pays tribute to the interdisciplinary nature of data science and provides a common understanding of data science terminology for readers with different backgrounds. These six chapters are geared towards drawing a consistent picture of data science and were predominantly written by the editors themselves. Part II then broadens the spectrum by presenting views and insights from diverse authors \u2013 some from academia and some from industry, ranging from financial to health and from manufacturing to e-commerce. Each of these chapters describes a fundamental principle, method or tool in data science by analyzing specific use cases and drawing concrete conclusions from them. The case studies presented, and the methods and tools applied, represent the nuts and bolts of data science. Finally, Part III was again written from the perspective of the editors and summarizes the lessons learned that have been distilled from the case studies in Part II. The section can be viewed as a meta-study on data science across a broad range of domains, viewpoints and fields. Moreover, it provides answers to the question of what the mission-critical factors for success in different data science undertakings are. The book targets professionals as well as students of data science: first, practicing data scientists in industry and academia who want to broaden their scope and expand their knowledge by drawing on the authors\u2019 combined experience. Second, decision makers in businesses who face the challenge of creating or implementing a data-driven strategy and who want to learn from success stories spanning a range of industries. Third, students of data science who want to understand both the theoretical and practical aspects of data science, vetted by real-world case studies at the intersection of academia and industry.","language":"en","currency":"USD","id":"3030118215","title":"Applied Data Science","infoLink":"https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/books\/details?id=JmydDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","authors":["Martin Braschler","Thilo Stadelmann","Kurt Stockinger"]},{"pageCount":516,"thumbnail":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=YJgvBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","price":151.2,"subtitle":"With Applications and Case Studies","description":"This book covers the latest advances in Big Data technologies and provides the readers with a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art in Big Data processing, analysis, analytics, and other related topics.

Innerhalb von 60 Sekunden werden weltweit etwa 694.445 Google Suchanfragen durchgeführt, 695.000 Status-Updates in Facebook gepostet, 168 Millionen E-Mails versandt und das Datenvolumen des Webs verdoppelt sich alle 18 Monate. Unternehmen sind gut darin beraten, dem Überfluss an Daten mit geeigneten Methoden und Technologien entgegenzutreten, da die alt bewährten Legacy Systeme (z.B. Data Warehouses) bereits an ihre technischen Grenzen stoßen. Obwohl Big Data sicherlich eine Herausforderung für die Unternehmen darstellt, ergeben sich auch neue Möglichkeiten und Umsatzquellen. Dafür gilt es nicht nur die Daten zu sammeln, sondern sie sollten auch analysiert und entsprechend ausgewertet werden. Ein wichtiger Schritt der Analyse und Auswertung von Unternehmensdaten ist die Systematisierung dieser. Die Seminararbeit versucht konkrete Ansätze zur Systematisierung von Unternehmensdaten vor dem Hintergrund von Big Data zu finden und diese zu evaluieren. Im Zuge der Arbeit werden hierfür Experten aus der Praxis hinzugezogen, die einerseits die theoretischen Ansätze aus einer praxisorientierten Sichtweise bewerten und andererseits auch horizonterweiterten Input zum Themenfeld Big Data und Analytics liefern.","language":"de","currency":"USD","id":"3668357927","title":"Ansätze zur Systematisierung von Unternehmensdaten vor dem Hintergrund von Big Data","infoLink":"https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/books\/details?id=GdiqDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","authors":["Alexander Pilipas","Michael Sack"]},{"pageCount":592,"thumbnail":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=VT3hAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","price":39.99,"subtitle":"","description":"\"SQL Success\" is about problem-solving in SQL. It bridges the gap between dry and dull database theory books, and developer books that focus on giving recipes without explaining sufficiently the reasons behind the recipes or discussing alternative solutions. Many developers struggle with SQL due to the contrast between the top-down logic of most programming languages and SQL's set-based approach. \"SQL Success\" aims to be different. This book is more than syntax examples. \"SQL Success\" explains how to use SQL to solve problems, and covers syntax in the process-not as the focus, but as a tool toward accomplishing the objective. \"SQL Success\" also shows something that most other books do not: the pitfalls and traps of SQL, a deceptively simple language, and how easy it is to get a query wrong. Written in a conversational way, \"SQL Success\" talks about logic more than theory, avoids jargon, and refers to common-sense more than rules. It ignores features that are rarely used and tries to avoid information overload. The intention of \"SQL Success\" is not to cover every aspect of all variants of SQL. The goal is to cover everything that is of practical use. That goal is informed by the author's many years of practical experience leading an understanding of what professional developers need to know, the common mistakes that are made, and how those mistakes can be avoided. * Focuses on the practical implications of theory. * Emphasizes accuracy and efficiency. * Teaches how to \"think SQL\", not merely the syntax. * Applies to Oracle, SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL, DB2, and SQLite. * Suitable for college-level database courses, SQL certification preparation, and professionals who want to take their database skills to the next level. * Bolstered by downloadable files and online database with practice exercises at edu.konagora.com. * Includes resources for instructors.","language":"en","currency":"USD","id":"1909765015","title":"SQL Success","infoLink":"https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/books\/details?id=VT3hAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","authors":["Stéphane Faroult"]},{"pageCount":720,"thumbnail":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=Lwb9CgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","price":30,"subtitle":"Exam 1Z0-809","description":"Complete, trusted preparation for the Java Programmer II exam OCP: Oracle Certified Professional Java SE 8 Programmer II Study Guide is your comprehensive companion for preparing for Exam 1Z0-809 as well as upgrade Exam 1Z0-810 and Exam 1Z0-813.
