Deploy and manage microservices using PM2 Monitoring the health of a microservice (CPU, memory, I\/O...) and how the degradation of the performance in one microservice could degrade the performance of full system. In Detail Microservices architecture is a style of software architecture. As the name suggests, microservicess refers to small services. For a large implementation, this means breaking the system into really small, independent services. Alternative to monolithic architecture (where the entire system is considered as a single big, interwoven segment), microservices approach is getting more and more popular with large, complex applications that have a very long lifecycle, which require changes at regular intervals. Microservices approach allows this type of changes with ease as only a part of the system undergoes changes and change control is easy. An example of such large system can be an online store\u2014includes user interface, managing product catalog, processing orders, managing customer's account. In a microservices architecture each of these tasks will be divided and into smaller services. Also, these services will be further broken down into independent services\u2014for user interface, there will be separate services for input, output, search bar management, and so on. Similarly, all other tasks can be divided in very small and simple services.

Advocates of NoSQL databases claim they can be used to build systems that are more performant, scale better, and are easier to program. NoSQL Distilled is a concise but thorough introduction to this rapidly emerging technology. Pramod J. Sadalage and Martin Fowler explain how NoSQL databases work and the ways that they may be a superior alternative to a traditional RDBMS. The authors provide a fast-paced guide to the concepts you need to know in order to evaluate whether NoSQL databases are right for your needs and, if so, which technologies you should explore further. The first part of the book concentrates on core concepts, including schemaless data models, aggregates, new distribution models, the CAP theorem, and map-reduce. In the second part, the authors explore architectural and design issues associated with implementing NoSQL. They also present realistic use cases that demonstrate NoSQL databases at work and feature representative examples using Riak, MongoDB, Cassandra, and Neo4j. In addition, by drawing on Pramod Sadalage\u2019s pioneering work, NoSQL Distilled shows how to implement evolutionary design with schema migration: an essential technique for applying NoSQL databases. The book concludes by describing how NoSQL is ushering in a new age of Polyglot Persistence, where multiple data-storage worlds coexist, and architects can choose the technology best optimized for each type of data access.","language":"en","currency":"USD","id":"013303612X","title":"NoSQL Distilled","infoLink":"https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/books\/details?id=AyY1a6-k3PIC&source=gbs_api","authors":["Pramod J.

Based on research in various domains including applied statistics, health informatics, data mining, machine learning, artificial intelligence, database management, and digital libraries, significant advances have been achieved over the last decade in all aspects of the data matching process, especially on how to improve the accuracy of data matching, and its scalability to large databases. Peter Christen\u2019s book is divided into three parts: Part I, \u201COverview\u201D, introduces the subject by presenting several sample applications and their special challenges, as well as a general overview of a generic data matching process. Part II, \u201CSteps of the Data Matching Process\u201D, then details its main steps like pre-processing, indexing, field and record comparison, classification, and quality evaluation. Lastly, part III, \u201CFurther Topics\u201D, deals with specific aspects like privacy, real-time matching, or matching unstructured data. Finally, it briefly describes the main features of many research and open source systems available today. By providing the reader with a broad range of data matching concepts and techniques and touching on all aspects of the data matching process, this book helps researchers as well as students specializing in data quality or data matching aspects to familiarize themselves with recent research advances and to identify open research challenges in the area of data matching. To this end, each chapter of the book includes a final section that provides pointers to further background and research material. Practitioners will better understand the current state of the art in data matching as well as the internal workings and limitations of current systems. Especially, they will learn that it is often not feasible to simply implement an existing off-the-shelf data matching system without substantial adaption and customization.

You'll also measure the effectiveness of your code improvements. You'll learn how to apply these techniques on projects both large and small. For small projects, you'll get new insights into your design and how well the code fits your ideas. For large projects, you'll identify the good and the fragile parts. Large-scale development is also a social activity, and the team's dynamics influence code quality. That's why this book shows you how to uncover social biases when analyzing the evolution of your system. You'll use commit messages as eyewitness accounts to what is really happening in your code. Finally, you'll put it all together by tracking organizational problems in the code and finding out how to fix them. Come join the hunt for better code! What You Need: You need Java 6 and Python 2.7 to run the accompanying analysis tools. You also need Git to follow along with the examples.","language":"en","currency":"USD","id":"1680505203","title":"Your Code as a Crime Scene","infoLink":"https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/books\/details?id=lA9QDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","authors":["Adam Tornhill"]},{"pageCount":252,"thumbnail":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=xcaiBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","price":16.54,"subtitle":null,"description":"This book is for both novice developers in general and experienced Spring developers.

You\u2019ll learn the basics of Swarm operation\u2014creating microservices containing only the parts of enterprise runtime needed in a specific case. Later, you\u2019ll learn how to configure and test those services. In order to deploy our services in the cloud, we\u2019ll use OpenShift. You\u2019ll get to know basic information on its architecture, features, and relationship to Docker and Kubernetes. Later, you\u2019ll learn how to deploy and configure your services to run in the OpenShift cloud. In the last part of the book, you\u2019ll see how to make your application production-ready. You\u2019ll find out how to configure continuous integration for your services using Jenkins, make your application resistant to network failures using Hystrix, and how to secure them using Keycloak. By the end of the book, you\u2019ll have a functional example application and will have practical knowledge of Java EE cloud development that can be used as a reference in your other projects.

It has changed how we view, access, and exchange information and, with the advent of REST, it has also provided us with compelling ways to build and improve automation solutions. REST provides a great deal of guidance to ensure that an architecture and its automation logic are technically sound, though it is still your responsibility to build services that actually add value to your business. SOA with REST is the first comprehensive tutorial and reference for designing and building RESTful services as part of service-oriented solutions and in conjunction with service-oriented architecture (SOA). This book demonstrates that REST is not only a suitable medium for building truly service-oriented solutions, but also that the service-oriented architectural model is a necessary foundation for REST technology architectures to realize their full business potential. The authors provide thorough mapping of REST constraints and architectural goals with service-orientation principles and SOA characteristics. Using real-world examples, they show how to leverage REST\u2019s simplicity, flexibility, and low overhead without compromising the power or manageability of service-oriented solutions and architectures. This ebook will be valuable to IT architects, developers, and any practitioner seeking to use SOA and REST together.","language":"en","currency":"USD","id":"0132869918","title":"SOA with REST","infoLink":"https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/books\/details?id=uXoXN-ZhmqMC&source=gbs_api","authors":["Thomas Erl","Benjamin Carlyle","Cesare Pautasso","Raj Balasubramanian","Herbj¿rn Wilhelmsen","David Booth"]}]
