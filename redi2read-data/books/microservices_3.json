Carola Lilienthal has analyzed more than 300 software systems written in Java, C#, C++, PHP, ABAP, and TypeScript and, together with her teams, has successfully refactored them. This book condenses her experience with monolithic systems, architectural and design patterns, layered architectures, domain-driven design, and microservices.

Although our primary focus is on JVM and Android, the knowledge we\u2019re sharing here, to various extents, applies to other Kotlin-supported platforms such as JavaScript, native and even multi-platform applications. The book starts with an introduction to the language and its ecosystem, which will give you an understanding of the key ideas behind the Kotlin design, introduce you to the Kotlin tooling and present you the basic language syntax and constructs. In the next chapters, we get to know the multi-paradigm nature of Kotlin which allows us to create powerful abstractions by combining various aspects of functional and object-oriented programming. We\u2019ll talk about using common Kotlin APIs, such as the standard library, reflection, and coroutine-based concurrency as well as the means for creating your own flexible APIs based on domain-specific languages. In the concluding chapters, we give examples of using Kotlin for more specialized tasks, such as testing, building Android applications, Web development and creating microservices. KEY FEATURES ● Language fundamentals ● Object-oriented and functional programming with Kotlin ● Kotlin standard library ● Building domain-specific languages ● Using Kotlin for Web development ● Kotlin for Android platform ● Coroutine-based concurrency WHAT WILL YOU LEARN By the end of the book you\u2019ll obtain a thorough knowledge of all the basic aspects of Kotlin programming. You\u2019ll be able to create a flexible and reusable code by taking advantage of object-oriented and functional features, use Kotlin standard library, compose your own domain-specific languages, write asynchronous code using Kotlin coroutines library as well. You\u2019ll also have a basic understanding of using Kotlin for writing test code, web applications and Android development. This knowledge will also give you a solid foundation for deeper learning of related development platforms, tools, and frameworks. WHO IS THIS BOOK FOR The book is primarily aimed at developers who are familiar with Java and JVM and are willing to get a firm understanding of Kotlin while having little to no experience in that language. Discussion of various language features will be accompanied, if deemed necessary, by comparisons with their Java\u2019s analogs, which should simplify the Java-to-Kotlin transition. Most of the material, however, is rather Java-agnostic and should be beneficial even without prior knowledge of Java.

More importantly, you will be challenged to reassess your professional values and your commitment to your craft. Clean Code is divided into three parts. The first describes the principles, patterns, and practices of writing clean code. The second part consists of several case studies of increasing complexity. Each case study is an exercise in cleaning up code\u2013of transforming a code base that has some problems into one that is sound and efficient. The third part is the payoff: a single chapter containing a list of heuristics and \u201Csmells\u201D gathered while creating the case studies.

Es beginnt mit einer Einführung in die Konzepte des Serverless Computing, den Vor- und Nachteilen dieser Technologie und beschreibt, wofür serverlose Anwendungen üblicherweise eingesetzt werden. Am Ende wird der Inhalt dieses Dokuments kurz zusammengefasst und die Frage beantwortet, \"wofür man Serverless Computing braucht und wofür es sich eher nicht eignet\". Serverloses Computing ist ein Ausführungsmodell für die Cloud, bei dem nur genau so viel Rechenressourcen und Speicherplatz dynamisch zugewiesen wird, wie zur Ausführung eines Codes benötigt wird. Dieser Vorgang wird auf einem von dem Cloud-Anbieter gewarteten Server ausgeführt. Serverless Computing ist also nicht tatsächlich Serverless. Der Begriff Serverless wird in dem Kontext nur benutzt, da der Cloud- Anbieter, der eine Serverless Computing Struktur hostet, die Bereitstellung und Wartung vollständig übernimmt. Natürlich sind immer noch Server beteiligt, aber nicht eigene, sondern die Server des Anbieters. Aus der Sicht des Entwicklerteams, das den Code schreibt und einsetzt, gibt es keine Server da Sie die Server nicht verwalten müssen und denn Code einfach bei ihrem Provider hochladen.","language":"de","currency":"USD","id":"3346339459","title":"Serverless Computing.
