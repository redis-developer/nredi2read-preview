It shows how to write clear and idiomatic Go to solve real-world problems. The book does not assume prior knowledge of Go nor experience with any specific language, so you\u2019ll find it accessible whether you\u2019re most comfortable with JavaScript, Ruby, Python, Java, or C++. The first chapter is a tutorial on the basic concepts of Go, introduced through programs for file I\/O and text processing, simple graphics, and web clients and servers. Early chapters cover the structural elements of Go programs: syntax, control flow, data types, and the organization of a program into packages, files, and functions. The examples illustrate many packages from the standard library and show how to create new ones of your own. Later chapters explain the package mechanism in more detail, and how to build, test, and maintain projects using the go tool. The chapters on methods and interfaces introduce Go\u2019s unconventional approach to object-oriented programming, in which methods can be declared on any type and interfaces are implicitly satisfied. They explain the key principles of encapsulation, composition, and substitutability using realistic examples. Two chapters on concurrency present in-depth approaches to this increasingly important topic. The first, which covers the basic mechanisms of goroutines and channels, illustrates the style known as communicating sequential processes for which Go is renowned. The second covers more traditional aspects of concurrency with shared variables. These chapters provide a solid foundation for programmers encountering concurrency for the first time. The final two chapters explore lower-level features of Go. One covers the art of metaprogramming using reflection. The other shows how to use the unsafe package to step outside the type system for special situations, and how to use the cgo tool to create Go bindings for C libraries. The book features hundreds of interesting and practical examples of well-written Go code that cover the whole language, its most important packages, and a wide range of applications. Each chapter has exercises to test your understanding and explore extensions and alternatives.

But if code isn\u2019t clean, it can bring a development organization to its knees. Every year, countless hours and significant resources are lost because of poorly written code. But it doesn\u2019t have to be that way. Noted software expert Robert C. Martin presents a revolutionary paradigm with Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship . Martin has teamed up with his colleagues from Object Mentor to distill their best agile practice of cleaning code \u201Con the fly\u201D into a book that will instill within you the values of a software craftsman and make you a better programmer\u2013but only if you work at it.

More importantly, you will be challenged to reassess your professional values and your commitment to your craft. Clean Code is divided into three parts. The first describes the principles, patterns, and practices of writing clean code. The second part consists of several case studies of increasing complexity. Each case study is an exercise in cleaning up code\u2013of transforming a code base that has some problems into one that is sound and efficient. The third part is the payoff: a single chapter containing a list of heuristics and \u201Csmells\u201D gathered while creating the case studies. The result is a knowledge base that describes the way we think when we write, read, and clean code.

This authoritative book scrapes away these bad features to reveal a subset of JavaScript that's more reliable, readable, and maintainable than the language as a whole\u2014a subset you can use to create truly extensible and efficient code. Considered the JavaScript expert by many people in the development community, author Douglas Crockford identifies the abundance of good ideas that make JavaScript an outstanding object-oriented programming language-ideas such as functions, loose typing, dynamic objects, and an expressive object literal notation. Unfortunately, these good ideas are mixed in with bad and downright awful ideas, like a programming model based on global variables. When Java applets failed, JavaScript became the language of the Web by default, making its popularity almost completely independent of its qualities as a programming language. In JavaScript: The Good Parts, Crockford finally digs through the steaming pile of good intentions and blunders to give you a detailed look at all the genuinely elegant parts of JavaScript, including: Syntax Objects Functions Inheritance Arrays Regular expressions Methods Style Beautiful features The real beauty? As you move ahead with the subset of JavaScript that this book presents, you'll also sidestep the need to unlearn all the bad parts. Of course, if you want to find out more about the bad parts and how to use them badly, simply consult any other JavaScript book. With JavaScript: The Good Parts, you'll discover a beautiful, elegant, lightweight and highly expressive language that lets you create effective code, whether you're managing object libraries or just trying to get Ajax to run fast.

In this era of big data and the Internet of Things, it is essential that we have the tools we need to understand the data coming to us faster than ever before, and to design databases and data processing systems that can adapt easily to ever-changing data schemas and ever-changing business requirements. There must be no intellectual disconnect between data and the software that manages it. It must be possible to extract meaning and knowledge from data to drive artificial intelligence applications. Novel NoSQL data organization techniques must be used side-by-side with traditional SQL databases. Are existing data modeling techniques ready for all of this? The Concept and Object Modeling Notation (COMN) is able to cover the full spectrum of analysis and design. A single COMN model can represent the objects and concepts in the problem space, logical data design, and concrete NoSQL and SQL document, key-value, columnar, and relational database implementations. COMN models enable an unprecedented level of traceability of requirements to implementation. COMN models can also represent the static structure of software and the predicates that represent the patterns of meaning in databases. This book will teach you: the simple and familiar graphical notation of COMN with its three basic shapes and four line styles how to think about objects, concepts, types, and classes in the real world, using the ordinary meanings of English words that aren\u2019t tangled with confused techno-speak how to express logical data designs that are freer from implementation considerations than is possible in any other notation how to understand key-value, document, columnar, and table-oriented database designs in logical and physical terms how to use COMN to specify physical database implementations in any NoSQL or SQL database with the precision necessary for model-driven development","language":"en","currency":"USD","id":"1634621115","title":"NoSQL and SQL Data Modeling","infoLink":"https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/books\/details?id=UmzQCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","authors":["Ted Hills"]},{"pageCount":272,"thumbnail":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=PSonZP4Nj5sC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","price":19.24,"subtitle":null,"description":"Practical Raspberry Pi takes you quickly through the hardware and software basics of the Raspberry Pi.

From Karen Lopez\u2019s Foreword: In this book, Thomas Frisendal raises important questions about the continued usefulness of traditional data modeling notations and approaches: Are Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERDs) relevant to analytical data requirements? Are ERDs relevant in the new world of Big Data? Are ERDs still the best way to work with business users to understand their needs? Are Logical and Physical Data Models too closely coupled? Are we correct in using the same notations for communicating with business users and developers? Should we refine our existing notations and tools to meet these new needs, or should we start again from a blank page? What new notations and approaches will we need? How will we use those to build enterprise database systems? Frisendal takes us through the history of data modeling, enterprise data models and traditional modeling methods. He points out, quite contentiously, where he feels we have gone wrong and in a few places where we got it right. He then maps out the psychology of meaning and context, while identifying important issues about where data modeling may or may not fit in business modeling. The main subject of this work is a proposal for a new exploration-driven modeling approach and new modeling notations for business concept models, business solutions models, and physical data models with examples on how to leverage those for implementing into any target database or datastore. These new notations are based on a property graph approach to modeling data.","language":"en","currency":"USD","id":"1634621239","title":"Graph Data Modeling for NoSQL and SQL","infoLink":"https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/books\/details?id=jugCDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","authors":["Thomas Frisendal"]},{"pageCount":161,"thumbnail":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=LGyCCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","price":7.99,"subtitle":"Criando aplicações web real-time com JavaScript","description":"O JavaScript já é uma opção real de desenvolvimento server-side.

Whether you use Node.js, Express, MongoDB, jQuery, AngularJS, or directly manipulate the DOM, you can test-drive JavaScript. Learn the craft of writing meaningful, deterministic automated tests with Karma, Mocha, and Chai. Test asynchronous JavaScript, decouple and properly mock out dependencies, measure code coverage, and create lightweight modular designs of both server-side and client-side code. Your investment in writing tests will pay high dividends as you create code that's predictable and cost-effective to change. Design and code JavaScript applications with automated tests. Writing meaningful tests is a skill that takes learning, some unlearning, and a lot of practice, and with this book, you'll hone that skill. Fire up the editor and get hands-on through practical exercises for effective automated testing and designing maintainable, modular code. Start by learning when and why to do manual testing vs. automated verification. Focus tests on the important things, like the pre-conditions, the invariants, complex logic, and gnarly edge cases. Then begin to design asynchronous functions using automated tests. Carefully decouple and mock out intricate dependencies such as the DOM, geolocation API, file and database access, and Ajax calls to remote servers. Step by step, test code that uses Node.js, Express, MongoDB, jQuery, and AngularJS. Know when and how to use tools such as Chai, Istanbul, Karma, Mocha, Protractor, and Sinon. Create tests with minimum effort and run them fast without having to spin up web servers or manually edit HTML pages to run in browsers. Then explore end-to-end testing to ensure all parts are wired and working well together. Don't just imagine creating testable code, write it.
