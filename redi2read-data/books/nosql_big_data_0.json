Fortunately, this book is the one.\" Feng Yu. Computing Reviews. June 28, 2016. This is a book for enterprise architects, database administrators, and developers who need to understand the latest developments in database technologies. It is the book to help you choose the correct database technology at a time when concepts such as Big Data, NoSQL and NewSQL are making what used to be an easy choice into a complex decision with significant implications. The relational database (RDBMS) model completely dominated database technology for over 20 years. Today this \"one size fits all\" stability has been disrupted by a relatively recent explosion of new database technologies. These paradigm-busting technologies are powering the \"Big Data\" and \"NoSQL\" revolutions, as well as forcing fundamental changes in databases across the board. Deciding to use a relational database was once truly a no-brainer, and the various commercial relational databases competed on price, performance, reliability, and ease of use rather than on fundamental architectures. Today we are faced with choices between radically different database technologies. Choosing the right database today is a complex undertaking, with serious economic and technological consequences. Next Generation Databases demystifies today\u2019s new database technologies. The book describes what each technology was designed to solve. It shows how each technology can be used to solve real word application and business problems. Most importantly, this book highlights the architectural differences between technologies that are the critical factors to consider when choosing a database platform for new and upcoming projects. Introduces the new technologies that have revolutionized the database landscape Describes how each technology can be used to solve specific application or business challenges Reviews the most popular new wave databases and how they use these new database technologies","language":"en","currency":"USD","id":"1484213297","title":"Next Generation Databases","infoLink":"https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/books\/details?id=q6pPCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","authors":["Guy Harrison"]},{"pageCount":192,"thumbnail":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=AyY1a6-k3PIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","price":19.79,"subtitle":"A Brief Guide to the Emerging World of Polyglot Persistence","description":"The need to handle increasingly larger data volumes is one factor driving the adoption of a new class of nonrelational \u201CNoSQL\u201D databases. Advocates of NoSQL databases claim they can be used to build systems that are more performant, scale better, and are easier to program. NoSQL Distilled is a concise but thorough introduction to this rapidly emerging technology. Pramod J. Sadalage and Martin Fowler explain how NoSQL databases work and the ways that they may be a superior alternative to a traditional RDBMS. The authors provide a fast-paced guide to the concepts you need to know in order to evaluate whether NoSQL databases are right for your needs and, if so, which technologies you should explore further. The first part of the book concentrates on core concepts, including schemaless data models, aggregates, new distribution models, the CAP theorem, and map-reduce. In the second part, the authors explore architectural and design issues associated with implementing NoSQL. They also present realistic use cases that demonstrate NoSQL databases at work and feature representative examples using Riak, MongoDB, Cassandra, and Neo4j. In addition, by drawing on Pramod Sadalage\u2019s pioneering work, NoSQL Distilled shows how to implement evolutionary design with schema migration: an essential technique for applying NoSQL databases. The book concludes by describing how NoSQL is ushering in a new age of Polyglot Persistence, where multiple data-storage worlds coexist, and architects can choose the technology best optimized for each type of data access.","language":"en","currency":"USD","id":"013303612X","title":"NoSQL Distilled","infoLink":"https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/books\/details?id=AyY1a6-k3PIC&source=gbs_api","authors":["Pramod J.

From Karen Lopez\u2019s Foreword: In this book, Thomas Frisendal raises important questions about the continued usefulness of traditional data modeling notations and approaches: Are Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERDs) relevant to analytical data requirements? Are ERDs relevant in the new world of Big Data? Are ERDs still the best way to work with business users to understand their needs? Are Logical and Physical Data Models too closely coupled? Are we correct in using the same notations for communicating with business users and developers? Should we refine our existing notations and tools to meet these new needs, or should we start again from a blank page? What new notations and approaches will we need? How will we use those to build enterprise database systems? Frisendal takes us through the history of data modeling, enterprise data models and traditional modeling methods. He points out, quite contentiously, where he feels we have gone wrong and in a few places where we got it right. He then maps out the psychology of meaning and context, while identifying important issues about where data modeling may or may not fit in business modeling. The main subject of this work is a proposal for a new exploration-driven modeling approach and new modeling notations for business concept models, business solutions models, and physical data models with examples on how to leverage those for implementing into any target database or datastore.

In this era of big data and the Internet of Things, it is essential that we have the tools we need to understand the data coming to us faster than ever before, and to design databases and data processing systems that can adapt easily to ever-changing data schemas and ever-changing business requirements. There must be no intellectual disconnect between data and the software that manages it. It must be possible to extract meaning and knowledge from data to drive artificial intelligence applications. Novel NoSQL data organization techniques must be used side-by-side with traditional SQL databases. Are existing data modeling techniques ready for all of this? The Concept and Object Modeling Notation (COMN) is able to cover the full spectrum of analysis and design. A single COMN model can represent the objects and concepts in the problem space, logical data design, and concrete NoSQL and SQL document, key-value, columnar, and relational database implementations. COMN models enable an unprecedented level of traceability of requirements to implementation. COMN models can also represent the static structure of software and the predicates that represent the patterns of meaning in databases.

You completed the MongoDB application within the given tight timeframe and there is a party to celebrate your application\u2019s release into production. Although people are congratulating you at the celebration, you are feeling some uneasiness inside. To complete the project on time required making a lot of assumptions about the data, such as what terms meant and how calculations are derived. In addition, the poor documentation about the application will be of limited use to the support team, and not investigating all of the inherent rules in the data may eventually lead to poorly-performing structures in the not-so-distant future. Now, what if you had a time machine and could go back and read this book. You would learn that even NoSQL databases like MongoDB require some level of data modeling. Data modeling is the process of learning about the data, and regardless of technology, this process must be performed for a successful application. You would learn the value of conceptual, logical, and physical data modeling and how each stage increases our knowledge of the data and reduces assumptions and poor design decisions. Read this book to learn how to do data modeling for MongoDB applications, and accomplish these five objectives: Understand how data modeling contributes to the process of learning about the data, and is, therefore, a required technique, even when the resulting database is not relational. That is, NoSQL does not mean NoDataModeling! Know how NoSQL databases differ from traditional relational databases, and where MongoDB fits. Explore each MongoDB object and comprehend how each compares to their data modeling and traditional relational database counterparts, and learn the basics of adding, querying, updating, and deleting data in MongoDB. Practice a streamlined, template-driven approach to performing conceptual, logical, and physical data modeling. Recognize that data modeling does not always have to lead to traditional data models! Distinguish top-down from bottom-up development approaches and complete a top-down case study which ties all of the modeling techniques together. This book is written for anyone who is working with, or will be working with MongoDB, including business analysts, data modelers, database administrators, developers, project managers, and data scientists. There are three sections: In Section I, Getting Started, we will reveal the power of data modeling and the tight connections to data models that exist when designing any type of database (Chapter 1), compare NoSQL with traditional relational databases and where MongoDB fits (Chapter 2), explore each MongoDB object and comprehend how each compares to their data modeling and traditional relational database counterparts (Chapter 3), and explain the basics of adding, querying, updating, and deleting data in MongoDB (Chapter 4). In Section II, Levels of Granularity, we cover Conceptual Data Modeling (Chapter 5), Logical Data Modeling (Chapter 6), and Physical Data Modeling (Chapter 7). Notice the \u201Cing\u201D at the end of each of these chapters. We focus on the process of building each of these models, which is where we gain essential business knowledge. In Section III, Case Study, we will explain both top down and bottom up development approaches and go through a top down case study where we start with business requirements and end with the MongoDB database. This case study will tie together all of the techniques in the previous seven chapters. Nike Senior Data Architect Ryan Smith wrote the foreword.

Winner of IBM\u2019s 2012 Gerstner Award for his implementation of big data and data warehouse initiatives and author of Practical Hadoop Security, author Bhushan Lakhe walks you through the entire transition process. First, he lays out the criteria for deciding what blend of re-architecting, migration, and integration between RDBMS and HDFS best meets your transition objectives. Then he demonstrates how to design your transition model. Lakhe proceeds to cover the selection criteria for ETL tools, the implementation steps for migration with SQOOP- and Flume-based data transfers, and transition optimization techniques for tuning partitions, scheduling aggregations, and redesigning ETL. Finally, he assesses the pros and cons of data lakes and Lambda architecture as integrative solutions and illustrates their implementation with real-world case studies.
