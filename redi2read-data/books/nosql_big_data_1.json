We will begin by covering Node.js, as it will lay the groundwork for all of our server-side work. You will learn how to get Node running on your local machine as well as download modules using npm. The key aspects of the Node.js programming model will also be covered. From there, we will move on to MongoDB, where you'll learn how to interact with Mongo from a Node application. You will also learn how to create, retrieve, update, and delete data from a Mongo store. After you have a solid grasp on Node and Mongo, the book will move on to the Express web server. We'll cover the basics of Express applications via topics like routes and middleware. Building on previous chapters, we will cover the integration of Node, Mongo, and Express. Our coverage of the MEAN stack will wrap up with several chapters on AngularJS. These chapters will cover Angular fundamentals like data binding, directives, controllers, routing, and services. In an effort to explore competing technologies, a slight introduction to Ember.js will also be provided. Full stack JavaScript is not fully encompassed by the MEAN stack. There is an entire ecosystem of JavaScript tools to learn about, and this book will introduce a few of them. We will cover task runners Gulp.js and Grunt.js which are extremely useful for automating mundane, repetitive tasks. We'll also cover JSHint, a linting tool used to improve code quality.

Integrate and copy data from your transactional systems into a specialized relational database, apply BI reporting and query tools and add business users. Job done. No longer. Analytics, big data and an array of diverse technologies have changed everything. More importantly, business is insisting on ever more value, ever faster from information and from IT in general. An emerging biz-tech ecosystem demands that business and IT work together. Business unIntelligence reflects the new reality that in today\u2019s socially complex and rapidly changing world, business decisions must be based on a combination of rational and intuitive thinking. Integrating cues from diverse information sources and tacit knowledge, decision makers create unique meaning to innovate heuristically at the speed of thought. This book provides a wealth of new models that business and IT can use together to design support systems for tomorrow\u2019s successful organizations. Dr. Barry Devlin, one of the earliest proponents of data warehousing, goes back to basics to explore how the modern trinity of information, process and people must be reinvented and restructured to deliver the value, insight and innovation required by modern businesses. From here, he develops a series of novel architectural models that provide a new foundation for holistic information use across the entire business. From discovery to analysis and from decision making to action taking, he defines a fully integrated, closed-loop business environment. Covering every aspect of business analytics, big data, collaborative working and more, this book takes over where BI ends to deliver the definitive framework for information use in the coming years. As the person who defined the conceptual framework and physical architecture for data warehousing in the 1980s, Barry Devlin has been an astute observer of the movement he initiated ever since. Now, in Business unIntelligence, Devlin provides a sweeping view of the past, present, and future of business intelligence, while delivering new conceptual and physical models for how to turn information into insights and action. Reading Devlin\u2019s prose and vision of BI are comparable to reading Carl Sagan\u2019s view of the cosmos.

Since the 1990s, the Internet has become the main driving force behind application development in all domains. An increase in the demand for resource sharing across different sites connected through networks has led to an evolution of data- and knowledge-management systems from centralized systems to decentralized systems enabling large-scale distributed applications providing high scalability. Current decentralized systems still focus on data and knowledge as their main resource. Feasibility of these systems relies basically on P2P (peer-to-peer) techniques and the support of agent systems with scaling and decentralized control. Synergy between grids, P2P systems, and agent technologies is the key to data- and knowledge-centered systems in large-scale environments. This, the 19th issue of Transactions on Large-Scale Data- and Knowledge-Centered Systems, contains four high-quality papers investigating the areas of linked data and big data from a data management perspective. Two of the four papers focus on the application of clustering techniques in performing inference and search over (linked) data sources. One paper leverages graph analysis techniques to enable application-level integration of institutional data and a final paper describes an approach for protecting users' profile data from disclosure, tampering, and improper use.","language":"en","currency":"USD","id":"3662465620","title":"Transactions on Large-Scale Data- and Knowledge-Centered Systems XIX","infoLink":"https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/books\/details?id=myfLBgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","authors":["Abdelkader Hameurlain","Josef Küng","Roland Wagner","Devis Bianchini","Valeria De Antonellis","Roberto De Virgilio"]},{"pageCount":73,"thumbnail":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=uaSSAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","price":25,"subtitle":null,"description":"Many applications process high volumes of streaming data, among them Internet traffic analysis, financial tickers, and transaction log mining. In general, a data stream is an unbounded data set that is produced incrementally over time, rather than being available in full before its processing begins. In this lecture, we give an overview of recent research in stream processing, ranging from answering simple queries on high-speed streams to loading real-time data feeds into a streaming warehouse for off-line analysis. We will discuss two types of systems for end-to-end stream processing: Data Stream Management Systems (DSMSs) and Streaming Data Warehouses (SDWs). A traditional database management system typically processes a stream of ad-hoc queries over relatively static data. In contrast, a DSMS evaluates static (long-running) queries on streaming data, making a single pass over the data and using limited working memory. In the first part of this lecture, we will discuss research problems in DSMSs, such as continuous query languages, non-blocking query operators that continually react to new data, and continuous query optimization. The second part covers SDWs, which combine the real-time response of a DSMS by loading new data as soon as they arrive with a data warehouse's ability to manage Terabytes of historical data on secondary storage.

For the past decade, the Hadoop framework has dominated the world of big data processing, yet recently academia and industry have started to recognize its limitations in several application domains and big data processing scenarios such as the large-scale processing of structured data, graph data and streaming data. Thus, it is now gradually being replaced by a collection of engines that are dedicated to specific verticals (e.g. structured data, graph data, and streaming data). The book explores this new wave of systems, which it refers to as Big Data 2.0 processing systems. After Chapter 1 presents the general background of the big data phenomena, Chapter 2 provides an overview of various general-purpose big data processing systems that allow their users to develop various big data processing jobs for different application domains. In turn, Chapter 3 examines various systems that have been introduced to support the SQL flavor on top of the Hadoop infrastructure and provide competing and scalable performance in the processing of large-scale structured data. Chapter 4 discusses several systems that have been designed to tackle the problem of large-scale graph processing, while the main focus of Chapter 5 is on several systems that have been designed to provide scalable solutions for processing big data streams, and on other sets of systems that have been introduced to support the development of data pipelines between various types of big data processing jobs and systems. Lastly, Chapter 6 shares conclusions and an outlook on future research challenges. Overall, the book offers a valuable reference guide for students, researchers and professionals in the domain of big data processing systems.

Organizations around the world are looking to exploit the explosive growth of data to unlock previously hidden insights in the hope of creating new revenue streams, gaining operational efficiencies, and obtaining greater understanding of customer needs. It is important to think of big data and analytics together. Big data is the term used to describe the recent explosion of different types of data from disparate sources. Analytics is about examining data to derive interesting and relevant trends and patterns, which can be used to inform decisions, optimize processes, and even drive new business models. With today's deluge of data comes the problems of processing that data, obtaining the correct skills to manage and analyze that data, and establishing rules to govern the data's use and distribution. The big data technology stack is ever growing and sometimes confusing, even more so when we add the complexities of setting up big data environments with large up-front investments. Cloud computing seems to be a perfect vehicle for hosting big data workloads. However, working on big data in the cloud brings its own challenge of reconciling two contradictory design principles. Cloud computing is based on the concepts of consolidation and resource pooling, but big data systems (such as Hadoop) are built on the shared nothing principle, where each node is independent and self-sufficient. A solution architecture that can allow these mutually exclusive principles to coexist is required to truly exploit the elasticity and ease-of-use of cloud computing for big data environments.

Prior knowledge of RDBMS solutions is assumed. What You Will Learn Enable Cassandra to co-exist with RDBMS and other legacy data stores Explore various design patterns to build effective and robust storage solutions Migrate from RDBMS-based data stores and caching solutions to Cassandra Understand the behaviour of Cassandra when trying to balance the needs of consistency, availability, and partition tolerance Deal with time stamps related to data effectively See how Cassandra can be used in analytical use cases Apply the design patterns covered in this book in real-world use cases In Detail There are many NoSQL data stores used by big data applications. Cassandra is one of the most widely used NoSQL data stores that is frequently used by a huge number of heavy duty Internet-scale applications. Unlike the RDBMS world, the NoSQL landscape is very diverse and there is no one way to model data stores. This mandates the need to have good solutions to commonly seen data store design problems. Cassandra addresses such common problems simply. If you are new to Cassandra but well-versed in RDBMS modeling and design, then it is natural to model data in the same way in Cassandra, resulting in poorly performing applications and losing the real purpose of Cassandra. If you want to learn to make the most of Cassandra, this book is for you. This book starts with strategies to integrate Cassandra with other legacy data stores and progresses to the ways in which a migration from RDBMS to Cassandra can be accomplished. The journey continues with ideas to migrate data from cache solutions to Cassandra. With this, the stage is set and the book moves on to some of the most commonly seen problems in applications when dealing with consistency, availability, and partition tolerance guarantees. Cassandra is exceptionally good at dealing with temporal data and patterns such as the time-series pattern and log pattern, which are covered next. Many NoSQL data stores fail miserably when a huge amount of data is read for analytical purposes, but Cassandra is different in this regard. Keeping analytical needs in mind, you'll walk through different and interesting design patterns. No theoretical discussions are complete without a good set of use cases to which the knowledge gained can be applied, so the book concludes with a set of use cases you can apply the patterns you've learned.

The data is becoming too big to manage and use with traditional tools. The solution: implementing a big data system. As Big Data Made Easy: A Working Guide to the Complete Hadoop Toolset shows, Apache Hadoop offers a scalable, fault-tolerant system for storing and processing data in parallel. It has a very rich toolset that allows for storage (Hadoop), configuration (YARN and ZooKeeper), collection (Nutch and Solr), processing (Storm, Pig, and Map Reduce), scheduling (Oozie), moving (Sqoop and Avro), monitoring (Chukwa, Ambari, and Hue), testing (Big Top), and analysis (Hive). The problem is that the Internet offers IT pros wading into big data many versions of the truth and some outright falsehoods born of ignorance. What is needed is a book just like this one: a wide-ranging but easily understood set of instructions to explain where to get Hadoop tools, what they can do, how to install them, how to configure them, how to integrate them, and how to use them successfully. And you need an expert who has worked in this area for a decade\u2014someone just like author and big data expert Mike Frampton. Big Data Made Easy approaches the problem of managing massive data sets from a systems perspective, and it explains the roles for each project (like architect and tester, for example) and shows how the Hadoop toolset can be used at each system stage. It explains, in an easily understood manner and through numerous examples, how to use each tool. The book also explains the sliding scale of tools available depending upon data size and when and how to use them. Big Data Made Easy shows developers and architects, as well as testers and project managers, how to: Store big data Configure big data Process big data Schedule processes Move data among SQL and NoSQL systems Monitor data Perform big data analytics Report on big data processes and projects Test big data systems Big Data Made Easy also explains the best part, which is that this toolset is free. Anyone can download it and\u2014with the help of this book\u2014start to use it within a day.

We present a generic evaluation framework for the performance, availability and reliability characteristics of various cloud platforms. We describe a generic benchmark architecture for cloud databases, specifically NoSQL database as a service. It measures the performance of replication delay and monetary cost. Service Level Agreements (SLA) represent the contract which captures the agreed upon guarantees between a service provider and its customers. The specifications of existing service level agreements (SLA) for cloud services are not designed to flexibly handle even relatively straightforward performance and technical requirements of consumer applications. We present a novel approach for SLA-based management of cloud-hosted databases from the consumer perspective and an end-to-end framework for consumer-centric SLA management of cloud-hosted databases. The framework facilitates adaptive and dynamic provisioning of the database tier of the software applications based on application-defined policies for satisfying their own SLA performance requirements, avoiding the cost of any SLA violation and controlling the monetary cost of the allocated computing resources. In this framework, the SLA of the consumer applications are declaratively defined in terms of goals which are subjected to a number of constraints that are specific to the application requirements. The framework continuously monitors the application-defined SLA and automatically triggers the execution of necessary corrective actions (scaling out\/in the database tier) when required. The framework is database platform-agnostic, uses virtualization-based database replication mechanisms and requires zero source code changes of the cloud-hosted software applications.","language":"en","currency":"USD","id":"3319047655","title":"Cloud Data Management","infoLink":"https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/books\/details?id=Qj-5BQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","authors":["Liang Zhao","Sherif Sakr","Anna Liu","Athman Bouguettaya"]},{"pageCount":348,"thumbnail":"http:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/content?id=WfadDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","price":196,"subtitle":null,"description":"The concept of a big data warehouse appeared in order to store moving data objects and temporal data information.

Algorithms are the keystone of data analytics and the focal point of this textbook. Clear and intuitive explanations of the mathematical and statistical foundations make the algorithms transparent. But practical data analytics requires more than just the foundations. Problems and data are enormously variable and only the most elementary of algorithms can be used without modification. Programming fluency and experience with real and challenging data is indispensable and so the reader is immersed in Python and R and real data analysis. By the end of the book, the reader will have gained the ability to adapt algorithms to new problems and carry out innovative analyses. This book has three parts:(a) Data Reduction: Begins with the concepts of data reduction, data maps, and information extraction. The second chapter introduces associative statistics, the mathematical foundation of scalable algorithms and distributed computing. Practical aspects of distributed computing is the subject of the Hadoop and MapReduce chapter.(b) Extracting Information from Data: Linear regression and data visualization are the principal topics of Part II. The authors dedicate a chapter to the critical domain of Healthcare Analytics for an extended example of practical data analytics. The algorithms and analytics will be of much interest to practitioners interested in utilizing the large and unwieldly data sets of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.(c) Predictive Analytics Two foundational and widely used algorithms, k-nearest neighbors and naive Bayes, are developed in detail. A chapter is dedicated to forecasting. The last chapter focuses on streaming data and uses publicly accessible data streams originating from the Twitter API and the NASDAQ stock market in the tutorials. This book is intended for a one- or two-semester course in data analytics for upper-division undergraduate and graduate students in mathematics, statistics, and computer science. The prerequisites are kept low, and students with one or two courses in probability or statistics, an exposure to vectors and matrices, and a programming course will have no difficulty. The core material of every chapter is accessible to all with these prerequisites. The chapters often expand at the close with innovations of interest to practitioners of data science. Each chapter includes exercises of varying levels of difficulty. The text is eminently suitable for self-study and an exceptional resource for practitioners.","language":"en","currency":"USD","id":"3319457977","title":"Algorithms for Data Science","infoLink":"https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/books\/details?id=JZLLDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","authors":["Brian Steele","John Chandler","Swarna Reddy"]}]
