You completed the MongoDB application within the given tight timeframe and there is a party to celebrate your application\u2019s release into production. Although people are congratulating you at the celebration, you are feeling some uneasiness inside. To complete the project on time required making a lot of assumptions about the data, such as what terms meant and how calculations are derived. In addition, the poor documentation about the application will be of limited use to the support team, and not investigating all of the inherent rules in the data may eventually lead to poorly-performing structures in the not-so-distant future. Now, what if you had a time machine and could go back and read this book. You would learn that even NoSQL databases like MongoDB require some level of data modeling. Data modeling is the process of learning about the data, and regardless of technology, this process must be performed for a successful application. You would learn the value of conceptual, logical, and physical data modeling and how each stage increases our knowledge of the data and reduces assumptions and poor design decisions. Read this book to learn how to do data modeling for MongoDB applications, and accomplish these five objectives: Understand how data modeling contributes to the process of learning about the data, and is, therefore, a required technique, even when the resulting database is not relational. That is, NoSQL does not mean NoDataModeling! Know how NoSQL databases differ from traditional relational databases, and where MongoDB fits. Explore each MongoDB object and comprehend how each compares to their data modeling and traditional relational database counterparts, and learn the basics of adding, querying, updating, and deleting data in MongoDB. Practice a streamlined, template-driven approach to performing conceptual, logical, and physical data modeling. Recognize that data modeling does not always have to lead to traditional data models! Distinguish top-down from bottom-up development approaches and complete a top-down case study which ties all of the modeling techniques together. This book is written for anyone who is working with, or will be working with MongoDB, including business analysts, data modelers, database administrators, developers, project managers, and data scientists. There are three sections: In Section I, Getting Started, we will reveal the power of data modeling and the tight connections to data models that exist when designing any type of database (Chapter 1), compare NoSQL with traditional relational databases and where MongoDB fits (Chapter 2), explore each MongoDB object and comprehend how each compares to their data modeling and traditional relational database counterparts (Chapter 3), and explain the basics of adding, querying, updating, and deleting data in MongoDB (Chapter 4). In Section II, Levels of Granularity, we cover Conceptual Data Modeling (Chapter 5), Logical Data Modeling (Chapter 6), and Physical Data Modeling (Chapter 7). Notice the \u201Cing\u201D at the end of each of these chapters. We focus on the process of building each of these models, which is where we gain essential business knowledge. In Section III, Case Study, we will explain both top down and bottom up development approaches and go through a top down case study where we start with business requirements and end with the MongoDB database. This case study will tie together all of the techniques in the previous seven chapters. Nike Senior Data Architect Ryan Smith wrote the foreword. Key points are included at the end of each chapter as a way to reinforce concepts. In addition, this book is loaded with hands-on exercises, along with their answers provided in Appendix A.

The lack of portability and interoperability between cloud platforms at different service levels is the main issue affecting cloud-based services today. The brokering, negotiation, management, monitoring and reconfiguration of cloud resources are challenging tasks for developers and users of cloud applications due to the different business models associated with resource consumption, and to the variety of services and features offered by different cloud providers. In chapter 1 the concepts of cloud portability and interoperability are introduced, together with the issues and limitations arising when such features are lacking or ignored. Subsequently, chapter 2 provides an overview of the state-of-the-art methodologies and technologies that are currently used or being explored to enable cloud portability and interoperability. Chapter 3 illustrates the main cross-platform cloud APIs and how they can solve interoperability and portability issues. In turn, chapter 4 presents a set of ready-to-use solutions which, either because of their broad-scale use in cloud computing scenarios or because they utilize established or emerging standards, play a fundamental part in providing interoperable and portable solutions.

The latest version of DB2 includes extensive native support for the PL\/SQL procedural language, new data types, scalar functions, improved concurrency, built-in packages, OCI, SQLPlus, and more. These features can help with developing applications that run on both DB2 and Oracle and can help simplify the process of moving from Oracle to DB2. In addition, IBM now provides tools to simplify the enablement process, such as the highly scalable IBM Data Movement Tool for moving schema and data into DB2, and an Editor and Profiler for PL\/SQL provided by the IBM Data Studio tool suite. This Oracle to DB2 migration guide describes new technology, preferred practices for moving to DB2, and common scenarios that can help you as you move from Oracle to DB2. This book is intended for IT architects and developers who are converting from Oracle to DB2. DB2 compatibility with Oracle is provided through native support. The new capabilities in DB2 that provide compatibility are implemented at the lowest and most intimate levels of the database kernel, as though they were originally engineered for DB2. means that the DB2 implementation is done without the aid of an emulation layer. This intimacy leads to the scalable implementation that DB2 offers, providing identical performance between DB2 compatibility features and DB2 other language elements.

In this book you will begin by installing and configuring PostgreSQL on a server by focusing on system-level parameter settings before installation. You will also look at key post-installation steps to avoid issues in the future. The basic configuration of PostgreSQL is tuned for compatibility rather than performance. Keeping this in mind, you will fine-tune your PostgreSQL parameters based on your environment and application behavior. You will then get tips to improve database monitoring and maintenance followed by database security for handling sensitive data in PostgreSQL. Every system containing valuable data needs to be backed-up regularly. PostgreSQL follows a simple back-up procedure and provides fundamental approaches to back up your data. You will go through these approaches and choose the right one based on your environment. Running your application with limited resources can be tricky.
